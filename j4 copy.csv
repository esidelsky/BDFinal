I hopped off the plane at LAX
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess (Whoa)
Am I gonna fit in?
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

[Pre-Chorus]
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And a JAY-Z song was on
And a JAY-Z song was on
And a JAY-Z song was on

[Chorus]
So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, yeah
Movin' my hips like, yeah
Got my hands up, they're playing my song
They know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A. 
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A. 
[Verse 2]
Get to the club in my taxi cab
Everybody's lookin' at me now
Like, ""Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks?
She gotta be from out of town""
So hard with my girls not around me
It's definitely not a Nashville party
'Cause all I see are stilettos
I guess I never got the memo

[Pre-Chorus]
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on

[Chorus]
So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, yeah

Back to my hometown tonight (Town tonight)

So I put my hands up
They're playing my song, the butterflies fly away

We got a pontoon boat with a Yamaha
People dressed like they're in Panama
Small town, spring break
Every weekend 'round this place
And there's a bunch of boys tryna catch the eyes
Of all the pretty girls that are walking by
And those redneck margaritas are two for one at that old marina, yeah
Tan lines and gas station cheap sunglasses
They're coming here from all around

[Chorus]
To get a little southbound, unwound, Tennessee Honey kinda buzz
Them south sounds up loud, summer drippin' off of us
From the river bank to the Party Cove
Long as it floats, we'll rock the boat
And it's all lookin' up when we get down, yeah
And get a little southbound, southbound
Get a little southbound, southbound

[Verse 2]
Bo got a ticket in a no-wake zone
But Katie's the one that should take it slow
'Cause she's dancin' on the dock and it's only 2 o'clock
Yeah, the fish ain't bitin' 'cause the party's on
The old men are thinkin' 'bout goin' home
But those redneck margaritas are two for one at that old marina, yeah
[Chorus]
We're gonna get a little southbound, unwound, Tennessee Honey kinda buzz
Them south sounds up loud, summer drippin' off of us
From the river bank to the Party Cove
Long as it floats, we'll rock the boat
And it's all lookin' up when we get down, yeah
And get a little southbound, southbound
Get a little southbound, southbound
Oh, yeah
Woo!

[Bridge]
Yeah, we got the rope swing swingin' like a chandelier
Little bit of heaven on the water ride here
Don't need much, just a couple of beers and you and me
Gotta love this time of year
Getting southbound, southbound

[Chorus]
So let's get a little southbound, unwound, Tennessee Honey kinda buzz
Them south sounds up loud, summer drippin' off of us
From the river bank to the Party Cove
Long as it floats, we'll rock the boat
And it's all lookin' up when we get down
And get a little southbound, southbound
Get a little southbound, southbound
Let's get a little southbound, southbound

I can't begin to know when

Heading down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hoping for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight

So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey mama rock me

[Verse 2]
Running from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more

So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey mama rock me
[Verse 3]
Walking to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I got to get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free

So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Oh rock me mama like the wind and the rain

Ah yeah, yo Ren, yo ready to do this shit?
Yeah, Dre, let's rip shit up
Hey yo, Yella Boy, why don't you kick me one of them funky ass beats?
Yo, we got my homeboy Eazy E in the house
Yeah, Compton's definitely in the house
Yo Ren, what we gonna call this shit? Tell 'em what yo name is
Yeah something like that
Alright, let's kick this shit on the one
Kick it

[Verse 1: MC Ren and Dr. Dre]
Back by demand, now it's big as fuck
Because you as the public, you should know what's up
""Compton's in the House"" was more than gold, it was a hit
Cause it was based on some crazy shit
So our final conclusion has been permitted
Punks made us a target and knew that we'd hit it
But that was a part of showbiz
Hey yo, homeboy, why don't you tell 'em what your name is

[Verse 2: MC Ren and Dr. Dre]
Well for the record it's Ren, and for the street it's villain
And strapped with a gat, it's more like Matt Dillon
On ""Gunsmoke"", but not a man of the law
I'm just the baddest motherfucker that you ever saw
See, I peep and then I creep on a fool
Get my blood pressure high, but still stay cool
Dig a grave of a nigga lookin' up to me
That really had the nerve that he could fuck with me
Who was the man in the mask, while I was waitin' to ask
You know, it's MC Ren kickin' mucho ass
Gettin' respect in showbiz
Hey yo homeboy, what's up?
Why don't you tell 'em what your name is?
[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
Dre, the motherfuckin' doctor, bitch hopper
The sucker-motherfucker stopper
Back with a vocal track that's a fresh one
So now, let's get the motherfuckin' session
Goin', flowin'. It's time to start throwin' - rhymes
So keep in mind all the suckers I'm blowin'
Cause I'm a start showin' the time
Never sayin' I'm the best and just goin' for mine
Unlike a lotta suckers who claim they're gettin' busy
When their records only make good frisbees
You need to quit runnin' off the mouth
Stop and think before you put some whack bullshit out
It's not difficult, in fact it's kinda simple
To create something funky that's original
You either talkin' 'bout the place to be
Who you are, what you got, or about a sucker MC

[Interlude: Dr. Dre and MC Ren]
Oh yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about, Ren
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, I know what you're sayin', Dre, but you still ain't told 'em enough, man
Alright, alright
Well, let's kick one more verse right here, alright
Kick it
[Verse 4: MC Ren & Dr. Dre]
This is portable, something to fuck with yo ear
Ren and Dre will appear when the sound is clear
To fuck it up like we always do, and that's the trick
Sayin' some shit to make the bitches wanna suck our dicks
But it's an everyday thang
Communicating to y'all with the Compton slang
Compton's back in the house and your appartment
So open your door, by the way, so we can start it
Test the monitors and call this mic
Cause the way we feel, we're gonna fuck it up tonight
I got my mic in my hand, with a hell of a grip
Bitches screamin' and shit, now it's a trip
Waitin' for the grand finale, or the end
Or stupid rhymes set by Dre and Ren
Well, like a kid, we get new shoes and go faster
Smilin', like hell, as we move past the
Suckers, the motherfuckers with the ego hype
Well we're positive and they're on a negative type
And if think we're about to quit...
Motherfucker you ain't heard shit

[Outro: MC Ren & Dr. Dre]
Yeah, that shit was funky, you know what I'm sayin', Ren?
I know what you're sayin', this is MC Ren and Dr. Dre
Cold kickin' it in the place
Ah yeah, my mellow Eazy E in the house
Yella Boy in the house
My boy Ice Cube
Arabian Prince cold rockin' shit
Oh yeah, hey, I'm a say whassup to my homeboys from CMW
Yeah, hey, yo Ren, whatta we gonna call this shit?

Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?

Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night

You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

Gone for the weekend or the rest of my life?

I was getting my float on
She was telling me so long
I was already so long gone

I was drunk as a skunk eating lunch with a cross eyed bear
You've been there
She was looking for something, better than me
I was looking for nothing, just riding the breeze
[Chorus]
Is she gone for the summer?
Gone for the night?
Gone for the weekend or the rest of my life?
Was she laughing?
Was she crying as she walked away?
I can't say
I was on a boat that day
The river was rolling
I was getting my float on
She was telling me so long
I was already so long gone
Yeah
Hey hey

[Bridge]
I remember it like it was yesterday
'Cause it was
And I still got a buzz

[Chorus]
Is she gone for the summer?
Gone for the night?
Gone for the weekend or the rest of my life?
Was she laughing?
Was she crying as she walked away?
I can't say
I was on a boat that day
The river was rolling
I was getting my float on
She was telling me so long
I was on a boat that day
The river was rolling

A full moon shining bright
Edge of the water; we were feeling alright
Back down a country road
The girls are always hot, and the beer is ice cold
Cadillac, horns on the hood
My buddy Frankie had his dad hook him up good
Girls smile when we roll by
They hop in the back, and we cruise to the river side

[Chorus]
Never gonna grow up
Never gonna slow down
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show
We were doin' it right
We were comin' alive
Yeah, caught up in a Southern summer, a barefoot, blue jean night

[Verse 2]
Blue eyes and auburn hair
Sittin' lookin' pretty by the fire in a lawn chair
New to town, and new to me
Her ruby red lips was sippin' on sweet tea
Shot me in love like a shootin' star
So, I grabbed a beer and my ol' guitar
Then we sat around till the break of dawn
Howlin' and singin' our favorite song
[Chorus]
Never gonna grow up
Never gonna slow down
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show
We were doin' it right

Never gonna grow up

You know I like my chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

[Verse 1]
Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia Pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea, pecan pie, and homemade wine where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground

[Chorus]
And a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

[Verse 2]
It's funny how it's the little things in life that mean the most
Not where you live, what you drive, or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a piece of mind
This I've come to know
So if you agree, have a drink with me
Raise your glasses for a toast
[Chorus]
To a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
I thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly, let it ring
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives so we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love

[Chorus]
Like our chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love
Get your little chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've done seen the sun rise

The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me

Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat

And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Hey, where did we go?
Days when the rains came
Down in the hollow
Playin' a new game
Laughing and a running, hey, hey
Skipping and a jumping
In the misty morning fog with
Our hearts a thumpin' and you
My brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

[Verse 2]
Whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow?
Going down the old mine
With a transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hiding behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and sliding
All along the waterfall, with you
My brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

[Chorus]
Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da
Just like that
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da la te da
[Verse 3]
So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, how you have grown
Cast my memory back there, Lord
Sometimes I'm overcome thinking 'bout
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium with you
My brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

I got my first real six string
Bought it at the five and dime
Played it til my fingers bled
Was the summer of '69

[Verse 1]
Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit and Jody got married
I shoulda known we'd never get far

[Chorus 1]
But when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Ya, I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life

[Verse 2]
Ain't no use in complainin'
When you got a job to do
Spent my evenin's down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you, ya

[Chorus 2]
Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh, and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life
Oh Yeah!
Back in the summer of '69
Oh!
[Bridge]
Man, we were killin' time
We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothin' can last forever
Forever, no...

[Interlude]
Yeah!

[Verse 3]
And now the times are changin'
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old six string
I think about ya 'n wonder what went wrong

[Chorus 3]
Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me it would last forever
Oh, the way you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

[Outro]
Oh yeah
Back in the summer of '69
Uh-huh
It was the summer of '69
Oh yeah

The 21st night of September?

While chasin' the clouds away
Our hearts were ringin'
In the key that our souls were singin'
As we danced in the night, remember
How the stars stole the night away, oh, yeah

The true love we share today

Hey, Matt
Yeah, Tim?
Hey, you talked to Marc lately?
Uh, haven't really talked to him but he looks pretty, uh, down
""He looks pretty, uh, down?""
Yeah, well, maybe we should cheer him up then
What do you, uh, suppose we should do?
Well, does he like butter tarts?

[Verse 1: Marc]
I was lying on the grass of Sunday morning of last week
Indulging in my self-defeat
My mind was thugged, all laced and bugged, all twisted, wrong and beat
A comfortable three feet deep
Now the fuzzy stare from not being there on a confusing morning week
Impaired my tribal lunar speak
And of course you can't become if you only say what you would have done
So I missed a million miles of fun

[Chorus: Marc & (Sharon)]
I know it's up for me
(If you steal my sunshine)
Making sure I'm not in too deep
(If you steal my sunshine)
Keeping versed and on my feet
(If you steal my sunshine)
[Spoken: Tim & Chad]
Chad, come here, come here, come here
Wow, look at her
I know
Man, I've never seen Sharon look so bad before
I did once before, but this is pretty bad
Yeah, what do you think she got up to last night?
Well, I... Sharon, I love you!

[Verse 2: Sharon]
I was frying on the bench slide in the park across the street
L-A-T-E-R that week
My sticky paws were into making straws out of big fat slurpy treats
An incredible eight-foot heap
Now the funny glare to pay a gleaming tare in a staring under heat
Involved an under usual feat
And I'm not only among but I invite who I want to come
So I missed a million miles of fun

[Chorus: Marc & (Sharon)]
I know it's up for me
(If you steal my sunshine)
Making sure I'm not in too deep
(If you steal my sunshine)
Keeping versed and on my feet
(If you steal my sunshine)
[Chorus 2: Marc & (Sharon)]
I know it's done for me
(If you steal my sunshine)
Not some and hard to see
(If you steal my sunshine)
Keeping dumb and built to beat
(If you steal my sunshine)

[Intro: Kanye West]
I'm living in that 21st century, doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music

[Chorus: Kanye West]
No one man should have all that power
The clock’s ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
(21st-century schizoid man)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
The system broken, the school's closed, the prison's open
We ain't got nothing to lose, motherfucker, we rolling
Huh? Motherfucker, we rolling
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I'll see you in the morning
Huh? I'll see you in the morning
This is way too much, I need a moment

[Chorus: Kanye West]
No one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically, they can kiss my asshole
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You short-minded niggas' thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows he's so fuckin' gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind, but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity, and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond-encrusted piece

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Thinking no one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the powder
'Til then, fuck that, the world’s ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
(21st-century schizoid man)
[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Colin Powells, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama's nation
Well, that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of the day, goddamnit, I'm killing this shit
I know damn well y'all feeling this shit
I don't need your pussy, bitch, I'm on my own dick
I ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with?
How Ye doing? I'm survivin'
I was drinkin' earlier, now I'm drivin'
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where you hidin'?
I got the power make your life so excitin'

[Outro: Kanye West & Dwele]
Now this will be a beautiful death
I'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go
I'm letting everything go
Mmm, now this will be a beautiful death
I'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go
I'm letting everything go
Now this will be a beautiful death
Jumping out the window, letting everything go
Letting everything go
You got the power to let power go?

Because she loves me so, and this I know for sure (Uh)

But can't stand to see me walk out the door? (Ah)

Early in the mornin', risin' to the street
Light me up that cigarette and I'll strap shoes on my feet
Got to find the reason, reason things went wrong
Got to find a reason why my money's all gone
I got a dalmatian and I can still get high
I can play the guitar like a motherfuckin' riot

[Verse 2]
Well, life is (too short), so love the one you got
'Cause you might get run over or you might get shot
Never start no static, I just get it off my chest
Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest
Take a small example, take a ti-ti-ti-tip from me
Take all of your money, give it all to charity-ty-ty-ty
Love is what I got, it's within my reach
And the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach
It all comes back to you, you're bound to get what you deserve
Try and test that, you're bound to get served
Love's what I got, don't start a riot

I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay
I don't get angry when my mom smokes pot

Living with Louie Dog's the only way to stay sane
Let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me

To ease my mind
I need to find, find
Someone to call mine

You can't hurry love

You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
You got to trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes

But how many heartaches must I stand
Before I find a love
To let me live again
Right now the only thing
That keeps me hangin' on
When I feel my strength
Yeah, it's almost gone
I remember mama said

You can't hurry love

How long must I wait
How much more can I take
Before loneliness
Will cause my heart, heart to break?

No I can't bear
To live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love
To call my own

No, love, love
Don't come easy
But I keep on waiting
Anticipating
For that soft voice
To talk to me at night
For some tender arms
To hold me tight
I keep waiting
I keep on waiting (Ooh, until that day)
But it ain't easy
It ain't easy
But mama said

Spit in my mouth, look in my eyes
This pussy is wet, come take a dive
Tie me up like I'm surprised
Let's roleplay, I'll wear a disguise
I want you to park that big Mack truck right in this little garage
Make it cream, make me scream
Out in public, make a scene
I don't cook, I don't clean
But let me tell you how I got this ring (Ayy, ayy)

He got a beard, well, I'm tryna wet it

Switch my wig, make him feel like he cheatin'
Put him on his knees, give him somethin' to believe in

In the food chain, I'm the one that eat ya
If he ate my ass, he's a bottom-feeder
Big D stand for big demeanor
I could make ya bust before I ever meet ya
If it don't hang, then he can't bang
You can't hurt my feelings, but I like pain
If he fuck me and ask ""Whose is it?""
When I ride the dick, I'ma spell my name, ah

We couldn't turn around 'til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now, but know I ain't too proud
I  couldn't be there even when I tried
You  don't believe it, we do this every time

Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm  waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

[Verse 2]
Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex though, the sex though
And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go

Uh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Khalid]
When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (Yeah)
Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus (Yeah)
I know your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day, she found a way out of the window to sneak out late

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know that we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah

[Chorus: Khalid]
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me
[Verse 2: Halsey]
Seventeen, and we got a dream to have a family
A house, and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly, we turned twenty-three
And now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Our old friends are now our enemies
And now I, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
He used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know where we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, singing

We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it

To start a new life together in a different place

But first of all, let me say
I must apologize for acting stank and treating you this way
'Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor

Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold

And I could be your favorite girl (Forever), perfectly together

Come help me out, I need to get me out of this joint
Come on, let's bounce, counting on you to turn me around
Instead of clowning around, let's look for some common ground
So baby, times get a little crazy
I've been gettin' a little lazy
Waitin' on you to come save me
I can see that you're angry by the way that you treat me
Hopefully you don't leave me, wanna take you with me

Summer coming through a rolled down window
Tearing down an almost two lane back road
Freedom and fireflies in the air
The night's still young, never going to get old
Living for today like there's no tomorrow
Follow the grooves, the tires in the grass
Staying on the gas like we're never coming back

[Chorus]
It's a Friday night, it's a small town girl
Everything is right and we rule the world
2 twelve's in the truck back, beating
A bunch of rock stars on a riverbank singing, whoa, whoa, everything, whoa, whoa
Everything we wanna be
We are, we are, we are tonight

[Verse 2]
Swaying back-n-forth, can't you feel the music?
Time stands still, I don't want to lose it
Her tan, her touch, her laugh
Were flying so high like we're never gonna crash

It's a Friday night, it's a small town girl
Everything is right and we rule the world

Everything we wanna be
We are, we are, we are tonight

We are tonight, we are tonight
Toes in the grass with our hands up high
Dream as big as the midnight sky
So untamed and we're so alive tonight

Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my own life behind

Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?

While you were clapping in the nosebleeds

Very superstitious
Writing's on the wall
Very superstitious
Ladder's about to fall
Thirteen month old baby
Broke the looking glass
Seven years of bad luck
The good things in your past

[Chorus]
When you believe in things
That you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way

[Verse 2]
Very superstitious
Wash your face and hands
Rid me of the problem
Do all that you can
Keep me in a daydream
Keep me going strong
You don't want to save me
Sad is my song
[Chorus]
When you believe in things
That you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way

[Verse 3]
Very superstitious
Nothing more to say
Very superstitious
The devil's on his way
Thirteen month old baby
Broke the looking glass
Seven years of bad luck
Good things in your past

That you don't understand
Then you suffer
