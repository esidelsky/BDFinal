Okay...
This is a song that uhh...
There's a lot of Christmas songs out there and uhh...
Not too many Chanukah songs
So uhh...
I wrote a song for all those nice little Jewish kids who don't get to hear any Chanukah songs
Here we go...

[Chorus]
Put on your yarmulke
Here comes Chanukah
So much fun-ukah
To celebrate Chanukah

[Pre-Verse]
Chanukah is the festival of lights
Instead of one day of presents, we have eight crazy nights
When you feel like the only kid in town without a Christmas tree
Here's a list of people who are Jewish just like you and me

[Verse 1]
David Lee Roth lights the menorah
So do James Caan, Kirk Douglas, and the late Dinah Shore-ah
Guess who eats together at the Carnegie Deli
Bowser from Sha Na Na and Arthur Fonzerelli
Paul Newman's half Jewish, Goldie Hawn's half too
Put them together, what a fine lookin' Jew
You don't need ""Deck The Halls"" or ""Jingle Bell Rock""
'Cause you can spin a dreidel with Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock—both Jewish
[Chorus]
Put on your yarmulke
It's time for Chanukah
The owner of the Seattle Supersonic-ahs
Celebrates Chanukah

[Verse 2]
O.J. Simpson, not a Jew
But guess who is? Hall of Famer Rod Carew—he converted
We got Ann Landers and her sister Dear Abby
Harrison Ford's a quarter Jewish—not too shabby
Some people think that Ebenezer Scrooge is
Well he's not, but guess who is
All Three Stooges!
So many Jews are in showbiz
Tom Cruise isn't, but I heard his agent is

[Chorus]
Tell your friend Veronica
It's time to celebrate Chanukah
I hope I get a harmonica
Oh this lovely, lovely Chanukah
So drink your gin and tonic-ah
And smoke your marijuana-kah
If you really, really wanna-kah
Have a happy, happy, happy, happy Chanukah
Happy Chanukah2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Happy Hanukkah! I wanna give a gift to you
Light up the night, my love shine through
From Mount Zion, this is what we do, bring love to you
Happy Hanukkah! I wanna give a gift to you
Light up the night, my love shine through
From Mount Zion, this is what we do, bring love to you, oh

[Verse 1]
Today is the day, tonight is the night
Sons of twilight had done come along, take flight
High and twinkling, and swindling and a shooting in the sky
I'm shining, and I’m feeling alright
Light a candle for the one you love
Peace and light from below to above
Eight nights, celebrate till I'm flying in the sky like a dove

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me unwind as I light up a flame in the name of the Lion of Judah
Drop like a hammer when I fall like the rain sun shower
Feel the power when I hit like a train

[Chorus]
Happy Hanukkah! I wanna give a gift to you
Light up the night, my love shine through
From Mount Zion, this is what we do, bring love to you
Happy Hanukkah! I wanna give a gift to you
Light up the night, my love shine through
From Mount Zion, this is what we do, bring love to you
[Verse 2]
Looking into the cosmos, flows intact
When I write to excite, now I'm fighting back
Intertwined with the divine, it’s a battle for your spine
It's a battle from the ancient line
Son of King David, Maccabee till the end of time
You're my light in the hardest time
Yes you bring peace to my mind
Won't you please let me unwind

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, as I light up a flame in the name of the Lion of Judah
Drop like a hammer when I fall like the rain sun shower
Feel the power when I hit like a train

[Chorus]
Happy Hanukkah! I wanna give a gift to you
Light up the night, my love shine through
From Mount Zion, this is what we do, bring love to you
Happy Hanukkah! I wanna give a gift to you
Light up the night, my love shine through
From Mount Zion, this is what we do, bring love to you

Happy Hanukkah! I wanna give a gift to you
Light up the night, my love shine through
From Mount Zion, this is what we do, bring love to you
Happy Hanukkah! I wanna give a gift to you
Light up the night, my love shine through
From Mount Zion, this is what we do, bring love to you
Oh, happy Hanukkah! I wanna give a gift to you
Light up the night, my love shine through
From Mount Zion, this is what we do, bring love to you
Oh, celebration, get your hands up high, get your hands up high
Celebration, put your hands up high, put your hands up high
Put your hands straight to the

The spinning don't stop when you leave the cradle
You just slow down
Round and around the world you go
Spinning through the lives of the people you know
We all slow down

How you gonna keep on turnin' from day to day?
How you gonna keep from turnin' your life away?
No days you can borrow, no time you can buy
No trust in tomorrow, it's a lie

I feel like a spinning top or a dreidel
The spinning don't stop when you leave the cradle
You just slow down
Round and around the world you go
Spinning through the lives of the people you know
We all slow down

How you gonna keep on turnin' from day to day?
How you gonna keep from turnin' your life away?

And I feel like I'm dippin' and divin'
My sky shoes are spiked with lead heels
I'm lost in this star car I'm drivin'
But my air sole keeps pushin' big wheels
My world is a constant confusion
My mind is prepared to attack
My past, a persuasive illusion
I'm watchin' the future it's black

What do you know? You know just what you perceive
What can you show? Nothing of what you believe
And as you grow, each thread of life that you leave
Will spin around your deeds and dictate your needs
As you sell your soul and you sow your seeds
And you wound yourself and your loved one bleeds
And your habits grow, and your conscience feeds
On all that you thought you should be
I never thought this could happen to me

I feel like a spinning top or a dreidel
The spinnin' don't stop when you leave the cradle
You just slow down
Round and around this world you go
Spinnin' through the lives of the people you know
We all slow down

How you gonna keep on turning from day to day?
How you gonna keep from turning your life away?

But light one candle for the wisdom to know
When the peacemaker's time is at hand

To never become our own foe
And light one candle for those who are suffering
Pain we learned so long ago
Light one candle for all we believe in
Let anger not tear us apart
And light one candle to bind us together
With peace as the song in our heart

What is the memory that's valued so highly
That we keep it alive in that flame?
What's the commitment to those who have died
When we cry out they've not died in vain?
We have come this far, always believing
That justice will somehow prevail
Oh, this is the burden, this is the promise
This why we will not fail!

Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.

THE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.


THE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.

(A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons him.)

THE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.

THE IDIOT (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.) Grhahute!

THE CHILDREN Where's the great light?

THE IDIOT (Gobbing.) Ghaghahest.

(They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)

CISSY CAFFREY



I gave it to Molly
Because she was jolly,
The leg of the duck
The leg of the duck.

(Private Cart and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)

THE VIRAGO Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.

CISSY CAFFREY More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet.

(She sings.)

I gave it to Nelly
To stick in her belly
The leg of the duck
The leg of the duck.


(Private Cart and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond copper polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)

PRIVATE COMPTON (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.

PRIVATE CARR (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!

CISSY CAFFREY (Her voice soaring higher.)

She has it, she got it,
Wherever she put it
The leg of the duck.

(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)

STEPHEN Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.

(The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway.)

THE BAWD (Her voice whispering huskily.) Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst.

STEPHEN (Altius aliqantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista.

THE BAWD (Spits in their trail her jet of venom.) Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.

(Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with Bertha Supple, draws her shawl across her nostrils.)

EDY BOARDMAN (Bickering.) And say the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.

STEPHEN (Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti i sunt.

(He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.)

LYNCH So that?

STEPHEN (Looks behind.) So that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.

LYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!
STEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.

LYNCH Ba!

STEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold my stick.

LYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?

STEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam.

(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)

LYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.

(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.

Snakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.

At Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)

BLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!

(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)

BLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?

(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)

BLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.

(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)

BLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.

(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)

THE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)

THE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.

BLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.

(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)

THE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.

(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)

THE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?

BLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!

(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)

BLOOM Buenos noches, señorita Blanca, que calle es esta?

THE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.

BLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.

(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)

BLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)

BLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.

(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)

BLOOM O!

(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)

BLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.

(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)

RUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.

BLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.

RUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?

BLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.

RUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?

BLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.

RUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.

BLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.

RUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!

BLOOM Mamma!

ELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?

(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)

A VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!

BLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.

(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)

BLOOM Molly!

MARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?

BLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.

(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)

MARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.

(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)

BLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...

MARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.

BLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!

(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)

THE SOAP

We're a capital couple are Bloom and I;
He brightens the earth, I polish the sky.


(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)

SWENY Three and a penny, please.

BLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.

MARION (Softly.) Poldy!

BLOOM Yes, ma'am?

MARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?

(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)

BLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...

(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)

THE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.

(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)

BRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?

(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)

THE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.

(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)

GERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.

BLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.

THE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.

GERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.

(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)

MRS BREEN Mr.

BLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .

MRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!

BLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...

MRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!

BLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.

(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)

There's someone in the house with Dina
There's someone in the house, I know,
There's someone in the house with Dina
Playing on the old banjo.


(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)

BLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?

MRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!

BLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.

MRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.

BLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?

MRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.

BLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.

MRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.

BLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.

MRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.

BLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) Là ci darem la mano.

MRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.

BLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)

ALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.

MRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.

BLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?

MRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?

BLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.

(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)

RICHIE Best value in Dub.

(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)

PAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.

RICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...

(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)

RICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!

BLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.

MRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.

BLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.

MRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.

BLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?

MRS BREEN Let's.

(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)

THE BAWD Jewman's melt!

BLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?

MRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.

BLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...

MRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!

BLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.

MRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.

BLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .

MRS BREEN Too.

BLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .

MRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)

THE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.

THE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!

(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)

BLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.

THE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.

(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)

THE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.

(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)

THE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?

THE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.

THE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!

PRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.

PRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!

PRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.

THE NAVVY (Shouts.)

We are the boys. Of Wexford.

PRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?

PRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.

THENAVVY (Shouts.)

The galling chain.
And free our native land.


(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)

BLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.

(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)

Odd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)

THE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.

BLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son goût. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.

(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)

THE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.

(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)

FIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.

BLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.

(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)

THE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.

BLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.

(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)

BOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.

(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)

SECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.

BLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.

(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)

SIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.

FIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.

BLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.

FIRST WATCH Proof.

(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)

BLOOM (In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.

FIRST WATCH (Reads.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully watching and besetting.

SECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.

BLOOM (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. (Plausibly.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom. The change of name Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially.) We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He shoulders the second watch gently.) Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first watch.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch gaily.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake of a lamb's tail.

(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)

THE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.

MARTHA (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.

FIRST WATCH (Sternly.) Come to the station.

BLOOM (Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.

MARTHA (Sobbing behind her veil.) Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.

BLOOM (Behind his hand.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim.) Shitbroleeth.

SECOND WATCH (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.) You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.

BLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.

FIRST WATCH Regiment.

BLOOM (Turns to the gallery.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.

A VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?

BLOOM (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) My old dad too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet feeling.) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.

FIRST WATCH Profession or trade.

BLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...

(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)

MYLES CRAWFORD (His cock's wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arse wiper here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?

(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled Matcham's Masterstrokes.)

BEAUFOY (Drawls.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.

BLOOM (Murmurs with hangdog meekness.) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?

BEAUFOY (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.

BLOOM (Indistinctly.) University of life. Bad art.

BEAUFOY (Shouts.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio.) We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.

A VOICE FROM THE GALLERY

Moses, Moses, king of the jews,
Wiped his arse in the Daily News.


BLOOM (Bravely.) Overdrawn.

BEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (To the court.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. The arch conspirator of the age.

BLOOM (To the court.) And he, a bachelor, how.

FIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.

THE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!

(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)

SECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?

MARY DRISCOLL (Indignantly.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.

FIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?

MARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.

BLOOM (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) I treated you white. I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.

MARY DRISCOLL (Excitedly.) As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!

FIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?

MARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twice with my clothing.

BLOOM She counterassaulted.

MARY DRISCOLL (Scornfully.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet!

(General laughter.)

GEORGES FOTTRELL (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.

(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )

(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)

LONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (Without looking up from their notebooks.) Loosen his boots.

PROFESSOR MACHUGH (From the presstable, coughs and calls.) Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.

(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket. Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A Titbits back number.)

(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)

J. J. O'MOLLOY (In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.

BLOOM (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (He begins to lilt simply.)

Li li poo lil chile,
Blingee pigfoot evly night.
Payee two shilly...


(He is howled down.)

J. J. O'MOLLOY (Hotly to the populace.) This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (To Bloom.) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.

BLOOM A penny in the pound.

(The mirage of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney.)

DLUGACZ (Hoarsely.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.

(J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)

J. J. O'MOLLOY (Almost voicelessly.) Excuse me, I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words. (He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)

BLOOM (In court dress.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . Queens of Dublin Society. (Carelessly.) I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...

MRS YELVERTON BARRY (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) Arrest him constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.

MRS BELLINGHAM (In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.

MRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!

(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)

THE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS (Screaming.) Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!

SECOND WATCH (Produces handcuffs.) Here are the darbies.

MRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.

MRS BELLINGHAM Me too.

MRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.

(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom.)

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.

BLOOM (His eyes closing, quails expectantly.) Here? (He squirms.) Again! (He pants cringing.) I love the danger.

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.

MRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it!

MRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married man!

BLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Laughs derisively.) O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.

MRS BELLINGHAM (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.) Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.

BLOOM (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien.) O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once. (He offers the other cheek.)

MRS YELVERTON BARRY (Severely.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.) I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air.) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?

BLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.) The weather has been so warm.

(Davy Stephens, ringleted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)

DAVY STEPHENS Messenger of the Sacred Heart and Evening Telegraph with Saint Patrick's Day Supplement. Containing the new addresses of all the cuckolds in Dublin.

(The very reverend Canon O'Hanlon in cloth of gold cope elevates and exposes a marble timepiece. Before him Father Conroy and the reverend John Hughes S.J. bend low.)

THE TIMEPIECE (Unportalling.)

Cuckoo
Cuckoo
Cuckoo


(The brass quoits of a bed are heard to jingle.)

THE QUOITS Jigjag, Jigajiga. Jigjag.

(A panel of fog rolls back rapidly, revealing rapidly in the jurybox the faces of Martin Cunningham, foreman silkhatted, Jack Power Simon Dedalus, Tom Kernan, Ned Lambert, John Henry Menton, Myles Crawford, Lenehan, Paddy Leonard Nosey Flynn, M'Coy and the featureless face of a Nameless One.)

THE NAMELESS ONE Bareback riding. Weight for age. Gob, he organised her.

THE JURORS (All their heads turned to his voice.) Really?

THE NAMELESS ONE (Snarls.) Arse over tip. Hundred shillings to five.

THE JURORS (All their heads lowered in assent.) Most of us thought as much.

FIRST WATCH He is a marked man. Another girl's plait cut. Wanted: Jack the Ripper. A thousand pounds reward.

SECOND WATCH (Awed, whispers.) And in black. A mormon. Anarchist.

THE CRIER (Loudly.) Whereas Leopold Bloom of no fixed abode is a well-known dynamitard, forger, bigamist, bawd and cuckold ad a public nuisance to the citizens of Dublin and whereas at this commission of assizes the most honourable.

(His Honour sir Frederick Falkiner recorder of Dublin, in judicial garb of grey stone rises from the bench, stonebearded. He bears in his arms an umbrella sceptre. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic ramshorns.)

THE RECORDER I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid Dublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! (He dons the black cap.) Let him be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty's pleasure and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril or may the Lord have-mercy on your soul. Remove him. (A black skullcap descends upon his head.)

(The subsheriff long John Fanning appears, smoking a pungent Henry Clay.)

LONG JOHN FANNING (Scowls and calls with rich rolling utterance.) Who'll hang Judas Iscariot?

(H. Rumbold, master barber in a bloodcoloured jerk in and tanner's apron, a rope coiled over his shoulder mounts the block. A life preserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. He rubs grimly his grapping hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.)

RUMBOLD (To the recorder with sinister familiarity.) Hanging Harry, your Majesty, the Mersey terror. Five guineas a jugular. Neck or nothing.

(The bells of George's church toll slowly, loud dark iron.)

THE BELLS Heigho! Heigho!

BLOOM (Desperately.) Wait. Stop. Gulls. Good heart. I saw. Innocence. Girl in the monkeyhouse. Zoo. Lewd chimpanzees. (Breathlessly.) Pelvic basin. Her artless blush unmanned me. (Overcome with emotion.) I left the precincts. (He turns to a figure in the crowd, appealing.) Hynes, may I speak to you? You know me. That three shillings you can keep. If you want a little more .

HYNES (Coldly.) You are a perfect stranger.

SECOND WATCH (Points to the corner.) The bomb is here. FIRST WATCH Infernal machine with a time fuse. BLOOM No, no. Pig's feet. I was at a funeral. FIRST WATCH (Draws his truncheon.) Liar!

(The beagle lifts his snout, showing the grey scorbutic face of Paddy Dignam. He has gnawed all. He exhales a putrid carcasefed breath. He grows to human size and shape. His dachshund coat becomes a brown mortuary habit. His green eyeflashes bloodshot. Half of one ear all the nose and both thumbs are ghouleaten.)

PADDY DIGNAM (In a hollow voice.) It is true. It was my funeral. Doctor Finucane pronounced life extinct when I succumbed to the disease from natural causes.

(He lifts his mutilated ashen face moonwards and bays lugubriously.)

BLOOM (In triumph.) You hear?

PADDY DIGNAM Bloom, I am Paddy Dignam's spirit. List, list, O list!

BLOOM The voice is the voice of Esau.

SECOND WATCH (Blesses himself.) How is that possible?

FIRST WATCH It is not in the penny catechism.

PADDY DIGNAM By metempsychosis. Spooks.

A VOICE O rocks.

PADDY DIGNAM (Earnestly.) Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H. Menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor's Walk. Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. Hard lines. The poor wife was awfully cut up. Dow is she bearing it? Keep her off that bottle of sherry. (He looks round him.) A lamp. I must satisfy an animal need. That buttermilk didn't agree with me.

(The portly figure of John O'Connell, caretaker stands forth, holding a bunch of keys tied with crape. Beside him stands Father Coffey, chaplain, toad bellied, wrynecked, in a surplice and bandanna nightcap, holding sleepily a staff of twisted poppies.)

FATHER COFFEY (Yawns, then chants with a hoarse croak.) Namine. Jacobs Vobiscuits. Amen.

(Foghorns stormily through his megaphone.) Dignam, Patrick T., deceased.

PADDY DIGNAM (With pricked up ears, winces.) Overtones.

(He wriggles forward, places an ear to the ground.) My masters' voice!

JOHN O'CONNELL Burial docket letter number U. P. Eightyfive thousand. Field seventeen. House of Keys. Plot, one hundred and one.

(Paddy Dignam listens with visible effort, thinking, his tailstiffpointed, his ears cocked.)

PADDY DIGNAM Pray for the repose of his soul.

(He worms down through a coal hole, his brown habit trailing its tether over rattling pebbles. After him toddles an obese grandfather rat on fungus turtle paws under a grey carapace. Dignam's voice, muffled, is heard baying under ground: Dignam's dead and gone below. Tom Rochford, robinredbreasted, in cap and breeches, jumps from his two-columned machine.)

TOM ROCHFORD (A hand to his breastbone, bows.) Reuben J. A florin I find him. (He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare.) My turn now on. Follow me up to Carlow.

(He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the coalhole. Two discs on the columns wobble eyes of nought. All recedes. Bloom plodges forward again. He stands before a lighted house, listening. The kisses, winging from their bowers, fly about him, twittering, warbling, cooing.)

THE KISSES (Warbling.) Leo! (Twittering.) Icky licky micky sticky for Leo! (Cooing.) Coo coocoo! Yummyumm Wom worn! (Warbling.) Big comebig! Pirouette! Leopopold! (Twittering.) Leeolee! (Warbling.) O Leo!

(They rustle, flutter upon his garments, alight, bright giddyflecks, silvery sequins.)

BLOOM A man's touch. Sad music. Church music. Perhaps here.

(Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips down the steps and accosts him.)

ZOE Are you looking for someone? He's inside with his friend.

BLOOM Is this Mrs Mack's?

ZOE No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse. Mother Slipperslapper. (Familiarly.) She's on the job herself tonight with the vet, her tipster, that gives her all the winners and pays for her son in Oxford. Working overtime but her luck's turned today. (Suspiciously.) You're not his father, are you?

BLOOM Not I!

ZOE You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?

(His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand slides over his left thigh.)

ZOE How's the nuts?

BLOOM Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier I suppose. One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.

ZOE (In sudden alarm.) You've a hard chancre.

BLOOM Not likely.

ZOE I feel it.

(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips.)

BLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.

ZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?

(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)

ZOE You'll know me the next time.

BLOOM (Forlornly.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to.

(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white, still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes, strangely murmuring.)

ZOE (Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) Schorach ani wenowach, benoith Hierushaloim.

BLOOM (Fascinated.) I thought you were of good stock by your accent.

ZOE And you know what thought did?

(She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth sending on him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)

BLOOM (Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat awkward hand.) Are you a Dublin girl?

ZOE (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?

BLOOM (As before.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.

ZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.

BLOOM (In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!

(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)

THE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!

BLOOM (In alderman's gown and chain.) Electors of Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say, from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future. That's my programme. Cui Bono? But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance...

AN ELECTOR Three times three for our future chief magistrate!

(The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)

THE TORCH BEARERS Hooray!

(Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod vigorously in agreement.)

LATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON (In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral chain and lace white silk scarf) That alder man sir Leo Bloom's speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom.

COUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.

BLOOM (Impassionedly.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...

(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mille Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)

BLOOM'S BOYS

The wren, the wren,
The king of all birds,
Saint Stephen's his day,
Was caught in the furze.


A BLACKSMITH (Murmurs.) For the Honour of God! And is that Bloom? He scarcely looks thirtyone.

A PAVIOR AND FLAGGER That's the famous Bloom now, the world's greatest reformer. Hats off!

(All uncover their heads. Women whisper eagerly.)

A MILLIONAIRESS (Richly.) Isn't he simply wonderful?

A NOBLEWOMAN (Nobly.) All that man has seen!

A FEMINIST (Masculinely.) And done!

A BELLHANGER A classic face! He has the forehead of a thinker.

(Bloom's weather. A sunburst appears in the northwest.)

THE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR I here present your un doubted emperor president and king chairman, the most serene and potent and very puissant ruler of this realm. God save Leopold the First!

ALL God save Leopold the First!

BLOOM (In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and Connor with dignity.) Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.

WILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (In purple stock and shovel hat.) Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?

BLOOM (Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears.) So may the Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.

MICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (Pours a cruse of hair oil over Bloom's head.) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem. Leopold, Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!

(Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting.)

THE PEERS I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.

(Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond. His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)

BLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.

(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)

JOHN HOWARD PARNELL (Raises the royal standard.) Illustrious Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!

BLOOM (Embraces John Howard Parnell.) We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.

(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows all that he is wearing green socks.)

TOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.

BLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry, Bonafide Sabaoth, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.

THE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS Hear! Hear!

JOHN WYSE NOLAN There's the man that got away James Stephens.

A BLUECOAT SCHOOLBOY Bravo!

AN OLD RESIDENT You're a credit to your country, sir, that's what you are.

AN APPLEWOMAN He's a man like Ireland wants.

BLOOM My beloved subjects, a new era is about to dawn. I, Bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future.

(Thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland, under the guidance of Derwan the builder construct the new Bloomusalem. It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)

THE SIGHTSEERS (Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die.)

(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.)

THE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.

BLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!

(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock, billets doux in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole, bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days' indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets available for all tram lines, coupons of the royal and privileged Hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the World's Twelve Worst Books: Froggy and Fritz (politic), Care of the Baby (infantilic), So Meals for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth? (historic), Expel that Pain (medic), Infant's Compendium of the Universe (cosmic), Let's All Chortle (hilaric), Canvasser's Vade Mecum (journalic), love-letters of Mother Assistant (erotic), Who's Who in Space (astric), Songs that Reached Our Heart (melodic), Pennywise's Way to Wealth (parsimonic). A general rush and scramble. Women press forward to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings are held up.)

THE WOMEN Little father! Little father!

THE BABES AND SUCKLINGS

Clap clap hands till Poldy comes home,
Cakes in his pocket for Leo alone.


(Bloom, bending down, pokes Baby Boardman gently in the stomach.)


BABY BOARDMAN (Hiccups, curdled milk flowing from his mouth.) Hajajaja.


BLOOM (Shaking hands with a blind stripling.) My more than Brother! (Placing his arms round the shoulders of an old couple.) Dear old friends! (He plays pussy fourcorners with ragged boys and girls.) Peep! Bopeep! (He wheels twins in a perambulator.) Ticktacktwo wouldyousetashoe? (He performs juggler's tricks, draws red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet silk handkerchiefs from his mouth.) Roygbiv. 32 feet per second. (He consoles a widow.) Absence makes the heart grow younger. (He dances the Highland fling with grotesque antics.) Leg it, ye devils! (He kisses the bedsores of a palsied veteran.) Honourable wounds! (He trips up a fat policeman.) U.p.: up. U.p.: up. (He whispers in the ear of a blushing waitress and laughs kindly.) Ah, naughty, naughty! (He eats a raw turnip offered him by Maurice Butterly, farmer.) Fine! Splendid! (He refuses to accept three shillings offered him by Joseph Hynes, journalist.) My dear fellow, not at all! (He gives his coat to a beggar.) Please accept. (He takes part in a stomach race with elderly male and female cripples.) Come on, boys! Wriggle it, girls!


THE CITIZEN (Choked with emotion, brushes aside a tear in his emerald muffler.) May the good God bless him!


(The rams' horns sound for silence. The standard of Zion is hoisted.)


BLOOM (Uncloaks impressively, revealing obesity, unrolls a paper and reads solemnly.) Aleph Beth Ghimel Daleth Hagadah Tephilim Kosher Yom Kippur Hanukah Ros chaschana Beni Brith Bar Mitzvah Mazzoth Askenazim Meshuggah Talith.


(An official translation is read by Jimmy Henry, assistant town clerk.)


JIMMY HENRY The Court of Conscience is now open. His Most Catholic Majesty will now administer open air justice. Free medical and legal advice, solution of doubles and other problems. All cordially invited. Given at this our loyal city of Dublin in the year I of the Paradisiacal Era.


PADDY LEONARD What am I to do about my rates and taxes?


BLOOM Pay them, my friend.


PADDY LEONARD Thank you.


NOSEY FLYNN Can I raise a mortgage on my fire insurance?


BLOOM (Obdurately.) Sirs, take notice that by the law of torts you are bound over in your own recognisances for six months in the sum of five pounds.


J.J. O'MOLLY A Daniel did I say? Nay! A Peter O'Brien!


NOSEY FLYNN Where do I draw the five pounds?

CHRIS CALLINAN What is the parallax of the subsolar ecliptic of Aldebaran?

BLOOM Pleased to hear from you, Chris. K. II.

JOE HYNES Why aren't you in uniform?

BLOOM When my progenitor of sainted memory wore the uniform of the Austrian despot in a dank prison where was yours?

BEN DOLLARD Pansies?

BLOOM Embellish (beautify) suburban gardens.

BEN DOLLARD When twins arrive?

BLOOM Father (pater, dad) starts thinking.

LARRY O'ROURKE An eight day licence for my new premises. You remember me, sir Leo, when you were in number seven. I'm sending around a dozen of stout for the missus.

BLOOM (Coldly.) You have the advantage of me. Lady Bloom accepts no presents.

CROFTON This is indeed a festivity.

BLOOM (Solemnly.) You call it a festivity. I call it a sacrament.

ALEXANDER KEYES When will we have our own house of keys?

BLOOM I stand for the reform of municipal morals and the plain ten commandments. New worlds for old. Union of all, jew, moslem and gentile. Three acres and a cow for all children of nature. Saloon motor hearses. Compulsory manual labour for all. All parks open to the public day and night. Electric dishscrubbers. Tuberculosis, lunacy, war and mendicancy must now cease. General amnesty, weekly carnival, with masked licence, bonuses for all, esperanto the universal brotherhood. No more patriotism of barspongers and dropsical impostors. Free money, free love and a free lay church in a free lay state.

O'MADDEN BURKE Free fox in a free henroost.

DAVY BYRNE (Yawning.) Iiiiiiiiiaaaaaaach!

BLOOM Mixed races and mixed marriage.

LENEHAN What about mixed bathing?

(Bloom explains to those near him his schemes for social regeneration. All agree with him. The keeper of the Kildare Street Museum appears, dragging a lorry on which are the shaking statues of several naked goddesses, Venus Callipyge, Venus Pandemos Venus Metempsychosis, and plaster figures, also naked, representing the new nine muses, Commerce, Operatic Music, Amor Publicity, Manufacture, liberty of Speech, Plural Voting, Gastronomy, Private Hygiene, Seaside Concert Entertainments, Painless Obstetrics and Astronomy for the People.)

FATHER FARLEY He is an episcopalian, an agnostic, an any thingarian seeking to overthrow our holy faith.

MRS RIORDAN (Tears up her will.) I'm disappointed in you! You bad man!

MOTHER GROGAN (Removes her boot to throw it at Bloom.) You beast! You abominable person!

NOSEY FLYNN Give us a tune, Bloom. One of the old sweet songs.

BLOOM (With rollicking humour.)

I vowed that I never would leave her,
She turned out a cruel deceiver.
With my tooraloom tooraloom tooralcom tooraloom.


HOPPY HOLOHAN Good old Bloom! There's nobody like him after all.

PADDY LEONARD Stage Irishman!

BLOOM What railway opera is like a tramline in Gibraltar? The Rows of Casteele. (Laughter.)

LENEHAN Plagiarist! Down with Bloom!

THE VEILED SIBYL (Enthusiastically.) I'm a Bloomite and I glory in it. I believe in him in spite of all. I'd give my life for him, the funniest man on earth.

BLOOM (Winks at the bystanders.) I bet she's a bonny lassie.

THEODORE PUREFOY (In fishing cap and oilskin jacket.) He employs a mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.

THE VEILED SIBYL (Stabs herself.) My hero god! (She dies.)

(Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery, asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different storeys.)

ALEXANDER J. DOWIE (Violently.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!

THE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!

(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)

BLOOM (Excitedly.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.

DR MULLIGAN (In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow.) Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.

(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)

DR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.

DR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.

DR PUNCH COSTELLO The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.

DR DIXON (Reads a bill of health.) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.

(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s, wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)

BLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.

MRS THORNTON (In nursetender's gown.) Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.

(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindorée, Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates.)

A VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?

BLOOM (Darkly.) You have said it.

BROTHER BUZZ Then perform a miracle.

BANTAM LYONS Prophesy who will win the Saint Leger.

(Bloom walks on a net, covers his left eye with his left ear, passes through several walls, climbs Nelson's Pillar, hangs from the the ledge by his eyelids, eats twelve dozen oysters (shells included), heals several sufferers from kings evil, contracts his face so as to resemble many historical personages, lord Beaconsfield, lord Byron, Wat Tyler, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, Moses Mendelssohn, Henry Irving, Rip van Winkle, Rossuth, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Baron Leopold Rothschild, Robinson Crusoe, Sherlock Holmes, Pasteur, turns each foot simultaneously in different directions, bids the tide turn back, eclipses the sun by extending his little finger.)

A FEMALE INFANT (Shakes a rattle.) And under Ballybough bridge?

A HOLLYBUSH And in the devil's glen?

BLOOM (Blushes furiously all over from front to nates, three tears falling from his left eye.) Spare my past.

THE IRISH EVICTED TENANTS (In bodycoats, kneebreeches, with Donnybrook fair shillelaghs.) Sjambok him!

(Bloom with asses' ears seats himself in the pillory with crossed arms, his feet protruding. He whistles Don Giovanni, a cenar teco. Artane orphans, joining hands, caper round him. Girls of the Prison Gate Mission, joining hands, caper round in the opposite direction.)

THE ARTANE ORPHANS

You big, you bog, you dirty dog!
You think the ladies love you!


THE PRISON GATE GIRLS

If you see kay
Tell him he may
See you in tea
Tell him from me.


HORNBLOWER (In ephod and huntingcap, announces.) And he shall carry the sins of the people to Azazel, the spirit which is in the wilderness, and to Lilith, the nighthag. And they shall stone him and defile him, yea, all from Agendath Netaim and from Mizraim, the land of Ham.

(All the people cast soft pantomime stones at Bloom. Many bonafide travellers and ownerless dogs come near him and defile him. Mastiansky and Citron approach in gaberdines, wearing long earlocks. They wag their beards at Bloom.)

MASTIANSKY AND CITRON Belial! Laemlein of Istria! the false Messiah! Abulafia!

(George S. Mesias, Bloom's tailor, appears, a tailor's goose under his arm, presenting a bill.)

MESIAS To alteration one pair trousers eleven shillings.

BLOOM (Rubs his hands cheerfully.) Just like old times. Poor Bloom!

(Reuben J. Dodd, black bearded Iscariot, bad shepherd, bearing on his shoulders the drowned corpse of his son, approaches the pillory.)

REUBEN J. (Whispers hoarsely.) The squeak is out. A split is gone for the flatties. Nip the first rattler.

THE FIRE BRIGADE Pflaap!

BROTHER BUZZ (Invests Bloom in a yellow habit with embroidery of painted flames and high pointed hat. He places a bag of gunpowder round his neck and hands him over to the civil power, saying.) Forgive him his trespasses.

(Lieutenant Myers of the Dublin Fire Brigade by general request sets fire to Bloom. Lamentations.)

THE CITIZEN Thank heaven!

BLOOM (In a seamless garment marked I. H. S. stands upright amid phoenix flames.) Weep not for me, O daughters of Erin.

(He exhibits to Dublin reporters traces of burning. The daughters of Erin, in black garments with lace prayerbooks and long lighted candles in their hands, kneel down and pray.)

THE DAUGHTERS OF ERIN Kidney of Bloom, pray for us. Flower of the Bath, pray for us. Mentor of Menton, pray for us. Canvasser for the Freeman, pray for us. Charitable Mason, pray for us. Wandering Soap, pray for us. Sweets of Sin, pray for us. Music without Words, pray for us. Reprover of the Citizen, pray for us. Friend of all Frillies, pray for us. Midwife Most Merciful, pray for us. Potato Preservative against Plague and Pestilence, pray for us.

(A choir of six hundred voices, conducted by Mr Vincent O'Brien, sings the Alleluia chorus, accompanied on the organ by Joseph Glynn. Bloom becomes mute, shrunken, carbonised.)

ZOE Talk away till you're black in the face.

BLOOM (In caubeen with clay pipe stuck in the band, dusty brogues, an emigrant's red handkerchief bundle in his hand, leading a black bogoak pig by a sugaun, with a smile in his eye.) Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the father and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye.) All insanity. Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He gazes far away mournfully.) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. (He breathes softly.) No more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.

ZOE (Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet.) Honest? Till the next time. (She sneers.) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts.

BLOOM (Bitterly.) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle.

ZOE (In sudden sulks.) I hate a rotter that's insincere. Give a bleeding whore a chance.

BLOOM (Repentantly.) I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil. Where are you from? London?

ZOE (Glibly.) Hog's Norton where the pigs play the organs. I'm Yorkshire born. (She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple.) I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a short time? Ten shillings?

BLOOM (Smiles, nods slowly.) More, houri, more.

ZOE And more's mother? (She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws.) Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll peel off.

BLOOM (Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled pears.) Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster. (Earnestly.) You know how difficult it is. I needn't tell you.

ZOE (Flattered.) What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve for. (She pats him.) Come.

BLOOM Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.

ZOE Babby!

BLOOM (In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair, fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a chubby finger, his moist tongue tolling and lisping.) One two tlee: tlee tlwo tlone.

THE BUCKLES Love me. Love me not. Love me.

ZOE Silent means consent. (With little parted talons she captures his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the pass touch of secret monitor, luring him to doom.) Hot hands cold gizzard.

(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)

THE MALE BRUTES (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro.) Good!

(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)

ZOE (Her lucky hand instantly saving him.) Hoopsa! Don't fall upstairs.

BLOOM The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the threshold.) After you is good manners.

ZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.

(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)

KITTY (Coughs behind her hand.) She's a bit imbecilic. (She signs with a waggling forefinger.) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.) Respect yourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.) O, excuse!

ZOE More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)

KITTY (Peers at the gasjet.) What ails it tonight?

LYNCH (Deeply.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.

ZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.

(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)

KITTY (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!

ZOE (Promptly.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.

(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)

STEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Coela enarrant gloriam Domini. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. Mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.) Which side is your knowledge bump?

THE CAP (With saturnine spleen.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!

STEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!

THE CAP Bah!

STEPHEN Here's another for you. (He frowns.) The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which .

THE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.

STEPHEN (With on effort.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.

THE CAP Which? (Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)

STEPHEN (Abruptly.) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!

LYNCH (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins.) What a learned speech, eh?

ZOE (Briskly.) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.

(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)

FLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.

KITTY No!

ZOE (Explodes in laughter.) Great unjust God!

FLORRY (Offended.) Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ. O, my foot's tickling.

(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling.)

THE NEWSBOYS Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.

(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)

STEPHEN A time, times and half a time.

(Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)

ALL What?

THE HOBGOBLIN (His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus. (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)

FLORRY (Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly.) The end of the world!

(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)

THE GRAMOPHONE Jerusalem! Open your gates and sing Hosanna...

(A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star falls from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah. Along an infinite invisible tight-rope taut from zenith to nadir the End of the World, a two headed octopus in gillies kilts, busby and tartan filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the fob of the Three Lugs of Man.)

THE END OF THE WORLD (With a Scotch accent.) Wha'll dance the keel row, the keel row, the keel row?

(Over the passing drift and choking breathcoughs, Elijah's voice, harsh as a corncrakes, jars on high. Perspiring in a loose lawn surplice with funnel sleeves he is seen, vergefaced above a rostrum about which the banner of old glory is draped. He thumps the parapet.)

ELIJAH No yapping, if you please, in this booth. Jake Crane, Creole Sue, Dave Campbell, Abe Kirschner, do your coughing with your mouths shut. Say, I am operating all this trunk line. Boys, do it now. God's time is 12.25. Tell mother you'll be there. Rush your order and you play a slick ace. Join on right here! Book through to eternity junction, the nonstop run. Just one word more. Are you a god or a doggone clod? If the second advent came to Coney Island are we ready? Florry Christ, Stephen Christ, Zoe Christ, Bloom Christ, Kitty Christ, Lynch Christ, it's up to you to sense that cosmic force. Have we cold feet about the cosmos? No. Be on the side of the angels. Be a prism. You have that something within, the higher self. You can rub shoulders with a Jesus, a Gautama, an Ingersoll. Are you all in this vibration? I say you are. You once nobble that, congregation, and a buck joyride to heaven becomes a back number. You got me? It's a lifebrightener, sure. The hottest stuff ever was. It's the whole pie with jam in. It's just the cutest snappiest line out. It is immense, supersumptuous. It restores. It vibrates. I know and I am some vibrator. Joking apart and getting down to bedrock, A. J. Christ Dowie and the harmonial philosophy, have you got that? O.K. Seventyseven west sixtyninth street. Got me? That's it. You call me up by sunphone any old time. Bumboosers, save your stamps. (He shouts.) Now then our glory song. All join heartily in the singing. Encore! (He sings.) Jeru...

THE GRAMOPHONE (Drowning his voice.) Whorusalaminyour highhohhhh.

(The disc rasps gratingly against the needle.)

THE THREE' WHORES (Covering their ears, squawk.) Ahhkkk!

ELIJAH (In rolledup shirtsleeves, black in the face, shouts at the top of his voice, his arms uplifted.) Big Brother up there, Mr President, you hear what I done just been saying to you. Certainly, I sort of believe strong in you, Mr President. I certainly am thinking now Miss Higgins and Miss Ricketts got religion way inside them. Certainly seems to me I don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear. (He winks at his audience.) Our Mr President, he twig the whole lot and he ain't saying nothing.

KITTY-KATE I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did on Constitution hill. I was confirmed by the bishop. My mother's sister married a Montmorency. It was a working plumber was my ruination when I was pure.

ZOE-FANNY I let him larrup it into me for the fun of it.

FLORRY-TERESA It was in consequence of a portwine beverage on top of Hennessy's three stars I was guilty with Whelan when he slipped into the bed.

STEPHEN In the beginning was the word, in the end the world without end. Blessed be the eight beatitudes.

(The beatitudes, Dixon, Madden, Crotthers, Costello, Lenehan, Bannon, Mulligan and Lynch in white surgical students' gowns, four abreast, goosestepping, tramp fast past in noisy marching.)

THE BEATITUDES (Incoherently.) Beer beef battledog buybull businum barnum buggerum bishop.

LYSTER (In quakergrey kneebreeches and broadbrimmed hat, says discreetly.) He is our friend. I need not mention names. Seek thou the light.

(He corantos by. Best enters in hairdresser attire, shinily laundered, his locks in curlpapers. He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat.)

BEST (Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.) I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you know. Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says. (Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner; with carping accent.) Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.

(In the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaan MacLir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)

MANANAAN MACLIR (With a voice of waves.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. (With a voice of whistling seawind.) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won't have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. (With a cry of stormbirds.) Shakti, Shiva! Dark hidden Father! (He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead, I am the dreamery creamery butter.

(A skeleton judas hand strangles the light. The green light wanes to mauve. The gasjet wails whistling.)

THE GASJET Pooah! Pfuiiiiii!

(Zoe runs to the chandelier and, crooking her leg, adjusts the mantle.)

ZOE Who has a fag as I'm here?

LYNCH (Tossing a cigarette on to the table.) Here.

ZOE (Her head perched aside in mock pride.) Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?

LYNCH I'm not looking.

ZOE (Makes sheep's eyes.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?

(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)

VIRAG (Heels together bows.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.

BLOOM Granpapachi. But...

VIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?

BLOOM She is rather lean.

VIRAG (Not unpleasantly.) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head.) Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!

BLOOM (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) She seems sad.

VIRAG (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (More genially.) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.

BLOOM (Regretfully.) When you come out without your gun.

VIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...

BLOOM With?...

VIRAG (His tongue upcurling.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches.) Slapbang! There he goes again.

BLOOM The stye I dislike.

VIRAG (Arches his eyebrows.) Contact with a goldring, they say. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches.) It is a funny sound.

(He coughs encouragingly.) But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.

BLOOM (Reflecting.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .

VIRAG (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. La causa è santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside.) He will surely remember.

BLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?

VIRAG (Excitedly.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (He taps his parchmentroll energetically.) This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger.) You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively.) Keekeereekee!

(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)

BLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.

VIRAG (Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper.) Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!

BLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...

VIRAG (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags head with cackling raillery.) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.

BLOOM (Absently.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.

VIRAG (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the known...

BLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats.) Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly.) Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.

VIRAG (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries.) Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (He mews.) Luss puss puss puss! (He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw.) Well, well. He doth rest anon.

I'm a tiny tiny thing
Ever flying in the spring
Round and round a ringaring.
Long ago I was a king,
Now I do this kind of thing
On the wing, on the wing!
Bing!


(He rushes against the mauve shade flapping noisily.) Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.

(From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)

HENRY (In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.) There is a flower that bloometh.

(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards Zoe's neck. Henry gallant turns with pendent dewlap to the piano.)

STEPHEN (To himself.) Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my. Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way. Must visit old Deasy or telegraph. Our interview of this morning has left on me a deep impression. Though our ages. Will write fully tomorrow. I'm partially drunk, by the way. (He touches the keys again.) Minor chord comes now. Yes. Not much however.

(Almidano Artifoni holds out a batonroll of music with vigorous moustachework.)

ARTIFONI Ci rifletta. Lei rovina tutto.

FLORRY Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.

STEPHEN No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you the letter about the lute?

FLORRY (Smirking.) The bird that can sing and won't sing.

(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold's face.)

PHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street hospital, Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.

PHILIP DRUNK (Impatiently.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who was it told me his name?

(His lawnmower begins to purr.) Aha, yes. Zoe mou sas agapo. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere? Mac somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?

FLORRY And the song?

STEPHEN Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.

FLORRY Are you out of Maynooth? You're like someone I knew once.

STEPHEN Out of it now. (To himself.) Clever.

PHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER (Their lawnmowers purring with a rigadoon of grasshalms.) Clever ever. Out of it. Out of it. By the by have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.

ZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know you've a Roman collar.

VIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his pupils waxing.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles.) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries.) Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (He chases his tail.) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes.) Pchp! (He worries his butt.) Prrrrrht!

LYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.

ZOE (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.) He couldn't get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.

BLOOM Poor man!

ZOE (Lightly.) Only for what happened him.

BLOOM How?

VIRAG (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.

KITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.

PHILIP DRUNK (Gravely.) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position, Philippe?

PHILIP SOBER (Gaily.) C'était le sacré pigeon, Philippe.

(Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair. And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whores shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)

LYNCH (Laughs.) And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes.

FLORRY (Nods.) Locomotor ataxy.

ZOE (Gaily.) O, my dictionary.

LYNCH Three wise virgins.

VIRAG (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!

(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)

BEN POLLARD (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.

(The virgins, Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley, burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)

THE VIRGINS (Gushingly.) Big Ben! Ben MacChree!

A VOICE Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.

BEN DOLLARD (Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.) Hold him now.

HENRY (Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) Thine heart, mine love. (He plucks his lutestrings.) When first I saw.

VIRAG (Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) Rats! (He yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchment roll.) After having said which I took my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. Dreck!

(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cows lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door his wild had slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)

THE FLYBILL K. 11. post no bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.

HENRY All is lost now.

(Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)

VIRAG'S HEAD Quack!

(Exeunt severally.)

STEPHEN (Over his shoulder to Zoe.) You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Anus Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.

LYNCH All one and the same God to her.

STEPHEN (Devoutly.) And Sovereign Lord of all things.

FLORRY (To Stephen.) I'm sure you are a spoiled priest. Or a monk.

LYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.

STEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.

(His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)

THE CARDINAL

Conservio lies captured.
He lies in the lowest dungeon
With manacles and chains around his limbs
Weighing upwards of three tons.


(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.) O, the poor little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.

(A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.) I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.

(His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male, melodious.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee, And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.

(The trick doorhandle turns.)

THE DOORHANDLE Theeee.

ZOE The devil is in that door.

(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)

ZOE (Sniffs his hair briskly.) Hum. Thank your mother for the rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.

BLOOM (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?

ZOE (Tears open the silverfoil.) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods. She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch.

(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)

KITTY (Chewing.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.

BLOOM (In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are.

(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)

BLOOM (Solemnly.) Thanks.

ZOE Do as you're bid. Here.

(A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs.)

BLOOM (Takes the chocolate.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats.) Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.

(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace pendant beryl eardrops.)

BELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.

(She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face, neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)

THE FAN (Flirting quickly, then slowly.) Married, I see.

BLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .

THE FAN (Half opening, then closing.) And the missus is master. Petticoat government.

BLOOM (Looks down with a sheepish grin.) That is so.

THE FAN (Folding together, rests against her eardrop.) Have you forgotten me?

BLOOM Yes. No.

THE FAN (Folded akimbo against her waist.) Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we? (Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)

BLOOM (Wincing.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.

THE FAN (Tapping.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.

BLOOM (Cowed.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably... (He winces.) Ah!

RICHIE GOULDING (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.

THE FAN (Tapping.) All things end. Be mine. Now.

BLOOM (Undecided.) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.

THE FAN (Points downwards slowly.) You may.

BLOOM (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. ) We are observed.

THE FAN (Points downwards quickly.) You must.

BLOOM (With desire, with reluctance.) I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!

(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)

BLOOM (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.

THE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.

BLOOM (Crosslacing.) Too tight?

THE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.

BLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!

(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)

BLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.

BELLO (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) Hound of dishonour!

BLOOM (Infatuated.) Empress!

BELLO (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) Adorer of the adulterous rump!

BLOOM (Plaintively.) Hugeness!

BELLO Dungdevourer!

BLOOM (With sinews semiflexed.) Magnificence.

BELLO Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!

BLOOM (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing.) Truffles!

(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)

BELLO (With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.

BLOOM (Enthralled, bleats.) I promise never to disobey.

BELLO (Laughs loudly.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.

(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.

ZOE (Widening her slip to screen her.) She's not here.

BLOOM (Closing her eyes.) She's not here.

FLORRY (Hiding her with her gown.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello. She'll be good, sir.

KITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.

BELLO (Coaxingly.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head.) There's a good girly now. (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.

BLOOM (Fainting.) Don't tear my.

BELLO (Savagely.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter. (He belches.) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler's Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.

(He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle.)

BLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!

BELLO (Twisting.) Another!

BLOOM (Screams.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!

BELLO (Shouts.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn you. (He slaps her face.)

BLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...

BELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.

ZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.

FLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.

KITTY No, me. Lend him to me.

(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)

MRS KEOCH (Ferociously.) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)

BELLO (Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke, nursing a fat leg.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear.) Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?

BLOOM (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!

BELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never prayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle.) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.

FLORRY (Pulls at Bello.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you.

ZOE (Pulling at Florry.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?

BLOOM (Stifling.) Can't.

BELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (He holds in his breath.) Curse it. Here. This bung's about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) Take that! (He recorks himself) Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.

BLOOM (A sweat breaking out over him.) Not man. (He sniffs.) Woman.

BELLO (Stands up.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.

BLOOM (Shrinks.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tip-touch it with my nails?

BELLO (Points to his whores.) As they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...

BLOOM (A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace male hands and nose, leering mouth.) I tried her things on only once, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.

BELLO (Jeers.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?

BLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.

BELLO (Guffaws.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&Aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again.) Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?

BLOOM (Her hands and features working.) It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.

BELLO (With wicked glee.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.

BLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.) And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.

BELLO (Sternly.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.

THE SINS OF THE PAST (In a medley of voices.) He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?

BELLO (Whistles loudly.) Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out. Be candid for once.

(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the... )

BLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...

BELLO (Peremptorily.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !

BLOOM (Docile, gurgles.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...

BELLO (Imperiously.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you're spoken to.

BLOOM (Bows.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!

(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)

BELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.

BLOOM Thank you, mistress.

BELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles.) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder's face.) Here, wet the deck and wipe it round!

A BIDDER A florin!

(Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)

A VOICE One and eightpence too much.

THE LACQUEY Barang!

CHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.

BELLO (Gives a rap with his gavel.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup.) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?

A DARKVISAGED MAN (In disguised accent.) Hoondert punt sterlink.

VOICES (Subdued.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.

BELLO (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blasé man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.

BLOOM (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.

BELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds of Bloom's haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly.) Can you do a man's job?

BLOOM Eccles Street.

BELLO (Sarcastically.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (He spits in contempt.) Spittoon!

BLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I.

BELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.

BLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...

BELLO (Ruthlessly.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see.

(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)

SLEEPY HOLLOW Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!

BLOOM (In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.

BELLO (Laughs mockingly.) That's your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student.

(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)

MILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!

BELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his men friends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos' Rest! Why not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander, O.

BLOOM They... I

BELLO (Cuttingly.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.

BLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove...

A VOICE Swear!

(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between his teeth.)

BELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.

BLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?

(He bites his thumb.)

BELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (He pipes scoffingly.) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!

BLOOM (Clasps his head.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff... (He weeps tearlessly.)

BELLO (Sneers.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!

(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.)

THE CIRCUMCISED (In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.

VOICES (Sighing.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.

(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom.)

THE YEWS (Their leaves whispering.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.

THE NYMPH (Softly.) Mortal! (Kindly.) Nay, dost not weepest!

BLOOM (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit.

THE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.

BLOOM (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) We have met before. On another star.

THE NYMPH (Sadly.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.

BLOOM You mean Photo Bits?

THE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.

BLOOM (Humbly kisses her long hair.) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.

THE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.

BLOOM (Quickly.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (He sighs.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.

THE NYMPH (Her fingers in her ears.) And words. They are not in my dictionary.

BLOOM You understood them?

THE YEWS Ssh.

THE NYMPH (Covers her face with her hand.) What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?

BLOOM (Apologetically.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago.

THE NYMPH (Bends her head.) Worse! Worse!

BLOOM (Reflects precautiously.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.

(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)

THE WATERFALL

Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.


THE YEWS (Mingling their boughs.) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.

JOHN WYSE NOLAN (In the background, in Irish National For ester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!

THE YEWS (Murmuring.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?

BLOOM (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.

(Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)

THE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray!

(They cheer.)

BLOOM (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for the High School!

THE ECHO Fool!

THE YEWS (Rustling.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom.) Who profaned our silent shade?

THE NYMPH (Coyly through parting fingers.) There! In the open air?

THE YEWS (Sweeping downward.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.

THE WATERFALL

Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
Phoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.


THE NYMPH (With wide fingers.) O! Infamy!

BLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?

(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)

STAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.

BLOOM Simply satisfying a need. (With pathos.) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play.

(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping curvants.)

THE NANNYGOAT (Bleats.) Megegaggegg! Nannannanny!

BLOOM (Hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine.) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes intently downwards on the water.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters.)

THE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?

(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin's King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)

COUNCILLOR NANNETI (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. I have...

BLOOM Done. Prff.

THE NYMPH (Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you... ?

BLOOM (Pacing the heather abjectly.) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.

THE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a knee.) And the rest.

BLOOM (Dejected.) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (With sudden fervour.) For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ?

(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing.)

THE VOICE OF KITTY (In the thicket.) Show us one of them cushions.

THE VOICE OF FLORRY Here.

(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)

THE VOICE OF LYNCH (In the thicket.) Whew! Piping hot!

THE VOICE OF ZOE (From the thicket.) Came from a hot place.

THE VOICE OF VIRAG (A birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns.) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!

BLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly full. It fills me full.

THE WATERFALL

Phillaphulla Poulaphouca
Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.


THE YEWS Ssh! Sister, speak!

THE NYMPH (Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and huge winged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilia convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel, the apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.

(Bloom half rises. His back trousers button snaps.)

THE BUTTON Bip!

(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)

THE SLUTS

O Leopold lost the pin of his drawers
He didn't know what to do,
To keep it up,
To keep it up.


BLOOM (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing, like an ass pissing.

THE YEWS (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms ageing and swaying.) Deciduously!

THE NYMPH Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (She clutches in her robe.) Wait, Satan. You'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins.) Nekum!

BLOOM (Starts up, seizes her hand.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat of nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruning knife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He clutches her veil.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good Mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?

THE NYMPH (With a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) Poli... !

BLOOM (Calls after her.) As if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph raises a keen.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. (He sniffs.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.

(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)

BELLA You'll know me the next time.

BLOOM (Composed, regards her.) Passée. Mutton dressed as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.

BELLA (Contemptuously.) You're not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.) Fohracht!

BLOOM (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.

BELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!

BLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!

BELLA (Turns to the piano.) Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul?

ZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms.) The cat's ramble through the slag. (She glances back.) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.

(Kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)

BLOOM (Gently.) Give me back that potato, will you? Zoe Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.

BLOOM (With feeling.) It is nothing, but still a relic of poor mamma.

ZOE

Give a thing and take it back
God'll ask you where is that
You'll say you don't know
God'll send you down below.


BLOOM There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.

STEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.

ZOE Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) Those that hides knows where to find.

BELLA (Frowns.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you smash that piano. Who's paying here?

(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)

STEPHEN (With exaggerated politeness.) This silken purse I made out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.) We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel où tenons nostre état.

LYNCH (Calls from the hearth.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.

STEPHEN (Hands Bella a coin.) Gold. She has it.

BELLA (Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty.) Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.

STEPHEN (Delightedly.) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.

(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)

FLORRY (Strives heavily to rise.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)

BELLA, ZOE. KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM (Chattering and squabbling.) The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.

STEPHEN (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.

ZOE (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.

LYNCH (Lifting Kitty from the table.) Come!

KITTY Wait. (She clutches the two crowns.)

FLORRY And me?

LYNCH Hoopla! (He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)

STEPHEN The fox crew, the cocks flew, The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for her poor soul To get out of heaven.

BLOOM (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and Florry.) So. Allow me. (He takes up the pound note.) Three times ten. We're square.

BELLA (Admiringly.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.

ZOE (Points.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)

BLOOM This is yours.

STEPHEN How is that? Le distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object falls.) That fell.

BLOOM (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) This.

STEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.

BLOOM (Quietly.) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?

STEPHEN (Hands him all his coins.) Be just before you are generous.

BLOOM I will but is it wise? (He counts.) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.

STEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly.) Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.

BLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.

STEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.

BLOOM No, but...

STEPHEN (Comes to the table.) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table.) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)

LYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.

STEPHEN (Brings the match nearer his eye.) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously.) Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.

ZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.

FLORRY (Nods.) Mr Lambe from London.

STEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.

LYNCH (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem. (The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it into the grate.)

BLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe.) You have nothing?

ZOE Is he hungry?

STEPHEN (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods.)

Hangende Hunger,
Fragende Frau,
Macht uns alle kaput.


ZOE (Tragically.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (She takes his hand.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (She points to his forehead.) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts.) Two, three, Mars, that's courage. (Stephen shakes his head.) No kid.

LYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake. (To Zoe.) Who taught you palmistry?

ZOE (Turns.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (To Stephen.) I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (She frowns with lowered head.)

LYNCH (Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.) Like that. Pandy bat.

(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)

FATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.

(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)

DON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very good little boy.

ZOE (Examining Stephen's palm.) Woman's hand.

STEPHEN (Murmurs.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.

ZOE What day were you born?

STEPHEN Thursday. Today.

ZOE Thursday's child has far to go. (She traces lines on his hand.) Line of fate. Influential friends.

FLORRY (Pointing.) Imagination.

ZOE Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... (She peers at his hands abruptly.) I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to know?

BLOOM (Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) More harm than good. Here. Read mine.

BELLA Show. (She turns up Bloom's hand.) I thought so. Knobby knuckles, for the women.

ZOE (Peering at Bloom's palm.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry money.

BLOOM Wrong.

ZOE (Quickly.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That wrong?

(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)

BLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.

(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)

BLOOM (Points to his hand.) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.

ZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.

STEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (He winces.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?

(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)

FLORRY What?

(A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)

THE BOOTS (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.) Haw, haw, have you the horn?

(Bronze by gold they whisper.)

ZOE (To Florry.) Whisper.

(They whisper again.)

(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder.)

LENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?

BOYLAN (Seated, smiles.) Plucking a turkey.

LENEHAN A good night's work.

BOYLAN (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (He holds out a forefinger.) Smell that.

LENEHAN (Smells gleefully.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!

ZOE AND FLORRY (Laugh together.) Ha ha ha ha.

BOYLAN bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. ) Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom up yet?

BLOOM (In a flunkey's plum plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings and powdered wig.) I'm afraid not, sir, the last articles...

BOYLAN (Tosses him sixpence.) Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head.) Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?

BLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.

MARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (She plops splashing out of the water.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.

BOYLAN (A merry twinkle in his eye.) Topping!

BELLA What? What is it?

(Zoe whispers to her.)

MARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.

BELLA (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.

BOYLAN (To Bloom, over his shoulder.) You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.

BLOOM Thank you, sir, I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? (He holds an ointment jar.) Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower?... Lukewarm water?...

KITTY (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.

(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)

MINA KENNEDY (Her eyes upturned.) O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! Stuck together! Covered with kisses!

LYDIA DOUCE (Her mouth opening.) Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round the room doing it! Ride a cock horse. You could hear them in Paris and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.

KITTY (Laughing.) Hee hee hee.

BOYLAN'S VOICE (Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach.) Ah! Gooblazqruk brukarchkrasht!

MARION'S VOICE (Hoarsely, sweetly rising to her throat.) O! Weeshwashtkissima, pooisthnapoohuck!

BLOOM (His eyes wildly dilated, clasps himself) Show! Hide! Show! Plough her! More! Shoot!

BELLA, ZOE, FLORRY. KITTY Ho ho! Ha ha! Hee hee!

LYNCH (Points.) The mirror up to nature. (He laughs.) Hu hu hu hu hu hu.

(Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)

SHAKESPEARE (In dignified ventriloquy.) 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (To Bloom.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon's laugh.) Iagogo! How my Oldfellow chokit his Thursdaymomun. Iagogogo!

BLOOM (Smiles yellowly at the whores.) When will I hear the joke?

ZOE Before you're twice married and once a widower.

BLOOM Lapses are condoned. Even the great Napoleon, when measurements were taken near the skin after his death...

(Mrs Dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with deathtalk, tears and Tunny's tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds, her bonnet awry, rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a pen chivvying her brood of cygnets. Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)

FREDDY Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!

SUSY Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!

SHAKESPEARE (With paralytic rage.) Weda seca whokilla farst.

(The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeares beardless face. The marqueeumbrella sways drunkenly, the children run aside. Under the umbrella appears Mrs Cunningham in Merry Widow hat and kimono gown. She glides sidling and bowing, twisting japanesily.)

MRS CUNNINGHAM (Sings.) And they call me the jewel of Asia.

MARTIN CUNNINGHAM

(Gazes on her impassive.) Immense! Most bloody awful demirep!

STEPHEN Et exaltabuntur cornua iusti. Queens lay with prize bulls. Remember Pasiphae for whose lust my grandoldgross father made the first confessionbox. Forget not Madam Grissel Steevens nor the suine scions of the house of Lambert. And Noah was drunk with wine. And his ark was open.

BELLA None of that here. Come to the wrong shop.

LYNCH Let him alone. He's back from Paris.

ZOE (Runs to Stephen and links him.) O go on! Give us some parleyvoo.

(Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face.)

LYNCH (Pommelling on the sofa.) Rmm Rmm Rmm Rrr rrrmmmmm.

STEPHEN (Gobbles, with marionette jerks. ) Thousand places of entertainment to expenses your evenings with lovely ladies saling gloves and other things perhaps her heart beerchops perfect fashionable house very eccentric where lots cocottes beautiful dressed much about princesses like are dancing cancan and walking there parisian clowneries extra foolish for bachelors foreigns the same if talking a poor english how much smart they are on things love and sensations voluptuous. Misters very selects for is pleasure must to visit heaven and hell show with mortuary candles and they tears silver which occur every night. Perfectly shocking terrific of religion's things mockery seen in universal world. All chic womans which arrive full of modesty then disrobe and squeal loud to see vampire man debauch nun very fresh young with dessous troublants. (He clocks his tongue loudly.) Ho, la la! Ce pif qu'il a!

LYNCH Vive le vampire!

THE WHORES Bravo! Parleyvoo!

STEPHEN (Grimacing with head back, laughs loudly, clapping himself) Great success of laughing. Angels much prostitutes like and holy apostles big damn ruffians. Demimondaines nicely handsome sparkling of diamonds very amiable cos turned. Or do you are fond better what belongs they moderns pleasure turpitude of old mans? (He points about him with grotesque gestures which Lynch and the whores reply to.) Caoutchouc statue woman reversible or lifesize tompeeptoms virgins nudities very lesbic the kiss five ten times. Enter gentlemen to see in mirrors every positions trapezes all that machine there besides also if desire act awfully bestial butcher's boy pollutes in warm veal liver or omelette on the belly pièce de Shakespeare.

BELLA (Clapping her belly, sinks back on the sofa with a shout of laughter.) An omelette on the... Ho! ho! ho! ho!... Omelette on the...

STEPHEN (Mincingly.) I love you, Sir darling. Speak you englishman tongue for double entente cordiale. O yes, mon loup. How much cost? Waterloo. Watercloset. (He ceases suddenly and holds up a forefinger.)

BELLA (Laughing.) Omelette...

THE WHORES (Laughing.) Encore! Encore!

STEPHEN Mark me. I dreamt of a watermelon.

ZOE Go abroad and love a foreign lady.

LYNCH Across the world for a wife.

FLORRY Dreams go by contraries.

STEPHEN (Extending his arms.) It was here. Street of harlots. In Serpentine Avenue Beelzebub showed me her, a fubsy widow. Where's the red carpet spread?

BLOOM (Approaching Stephen.) Look.

STEPHEN No, I flew. My foes beneath me. And ever shall be. World without end. (He cries.) Pater! Free!

BLOOM I say, look...

STEPHEN Break my spirit, will he? O merde alors! (He cries, his vulture talons sharpened.) Hola! Hillyho!

(Simon Dedalus' voice hilloes in answer, somewhat sleepy but ready.)

SIMON That's all right. (He swoops uncertainly through the air, wheeling, uttering cries of heartening, on strong ponderous buzzard wings.) Ho, boy! Are you going to win? Hoop! Pschatt! Stable with those halfcastes. Wouldn't let them within the bawl of an ass. Head up! Keep our flag flying! An eagle gules volant in a field argent displayed. Ulster king at arms! hai hoop! (He makes the beagle's call giving tongue.) Bulbul! Burblblbrurblbl! Hai, boy!

(The fronds and spaces of the wallpaper file rapidly across country. A stout fox drawn from covert, brush pointed, having buried his grandmother, runs swift for the open, bright-eyed, seeking badger earth, under the leaves. The pack of staghounds follows, nose to the ground, sniffing their quarry, beaglebaying, burblbrblng to be blooded. Ward Union huntsmen and huntswomen live with them, hot for a kill. From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey negroes waving torches. The crowd bowls of dicers, crown and anchor players, thimbleriggers, broadsmen. Crows and touts, hoarse bookies in high wizard hats clamour deafeningly.)

THE CROWD

Card of the races. Racing card!
Ten to one the field!
Tommy on the clay here!
Tommy on the clay!
Ten to one bar one.
Ten to one bar one.
Try your luck on spinning Jenny!
Ten to one bar one!
Sell the monkey, boys!
Sell the monkey!
I'll give ten to one!
Ten to one bar one!


(A dark horse, riderless, bolts like a phantom past the winningpost, his mane moonfoaming, his eyeballs stars. The field follows, a bunch of bucking mounts. Skeleton horses: Sceptre, Maximum the Second, Zinfandel, the Duke of Westminsters Shotover, Repulse, the Duke of Beauforts' Ceylon, prix de Paris. Dwarfs ride them, rusty armoured, leaping, leaping in their saddles. Last in a drizzle of rain, on a broken-winded isabelle nag, Cock of the North, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket, orange sleeves, Garrett Deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockey stick at the ready. His nag, stumbling on whitegaitered feet, jogs along the rocky road.)

THE ORANGE LODGES (Jeering.) Get down and push, mister. Last lap! You'll be home the night!

GARRETT DEASY (Bolt upright, his nailscraped face plastered with postage stamps, brandishes his hockeystick, his blue eyes flashing in the prism of the chandelier as his mount lopes by at a schooling gallop.) Per vias rectas!

(A yoke of buckets leopards all over him and his rearing nag, a torrent of mutton broth with dancing coins of carrots, barley, onions, turnips, potatoes.)

THE GREEN LODGES Soft day, sir John! Soft day, your honour!

(Private Carr, Private Compton and Cissy Caffrey pass beneath the windows, singing in discord.)

STEPHEN Hark! Our friend, noise in the street!

ZOE (Holds up her hand.) Stop!

PRIVATE CARR, PRIVATE COMPTON and CISSY CAFFREY

Yet I've a sort a
Yorkshire relish for...


ZOE That's me. (She claps her hands.) Dance! Dance! (She runs to the pianola.) Who has twopence?

BLOOM Who'll.

LYNCH (Handing her coins.) Here.

STEPHEN (Cracking his fingers impatiently.) Quick! Quick! Where's my augur's rod? (He runs to the piano and takes his ashplant, beating his foot in tripudium.)

ZOE (Turns the drumhandle.) There.

(She drops two pennies in the slot. Glow pink and violet lights start forth. The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing.)

ZOE (Twirls around herself heeltapping.) Dance. Anybody here for there? Who'll dance?

(The pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude to My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains, Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows and fondles his flower and buttons.)

MAGINNI The poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. No connection with Madam Legget Byrne's or Levinstone's. Fancy dress balls arranged. Deportment. The Katty Lanner steps. So. Watch me! My terpsichorean abilities. (He minuets forward three paces on tripping bee's feet.) Tout le monde an avant! Révérence! Tout le monde en place!

(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)

THE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.

(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. Laughing linked, high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting their arms.)

MAGINNI (Clipclaps glovesilent hands.) Carré! Avant deux! Breathe evenly! Balance!

(The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing to each other, shaping their curves, bowing vis a vis. Cavaliers behind them arch and suspend their arms, with hands descending to, touching, rising from their shoulders.)

HOURS You may touch my.

CAVALIERS May I touch your?

HOURS O, but lightly!

CAVALIERS O, so lightly!

THE PIANOLA My little shy little lass has a waist.

(Zoe and Stephen turn boldly with looser swing. The twilight hours advance, from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)

MAGINNI Avant! huit! Traversé! Salut! Cours de mains! Croisé!

(The eight hours steal to the last place. Morning, noon and twilight hours retreat before them. They are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets of dull bells. Weary, they curchycurchy under veils.)

THE BRACELETS Heigho! Heigho!

ZOE (Twisting, her hand to her brow.) O!

MAGINNI Los tiroirs! Chaîne de dames! La corbeille! Dos à dos!

(Arabesquing wearily, they weave a pattern on the floor, weaving, unweaving, curtseying, twisting, simply swirling.)

ZOE I'm giddy.

(She frees herself droops on a chair, Stephen seizes Florry and turns with her.)

MAGINNI Boulangère! Los ronds! Los ponts! Chevaux de bois! Escargots!

(Twining, receding, with interchanging hands, the night hours link, each with arching arms, in a mosaic of movements. Stephen and Florry turn cumbrously.)

MAGINNI Dansez avec vos dames! Changes de dames! Donnes le petit bouquet a votre dame! Remerciez!

THE PIANOLA

Best, best of all,
Baraabum!


KITTY (Jumps up.) O, they played that on the hobbyhorses at the Mirus bazaar!

(She runs to Stephen. He leaves Florry brusquely and seizes Kitty. A screaming bit tern's harsh high whistle shrieks. Groangrousegurgling Toft's cumbersome whirligig turns slowly the room right roundabout the room.)

THE PIANOLA My girl's a Yorkshire girl.

ZOE Yorkshire through and through. Come on all!

(She seizes Florry and waltzes her.)

STEPHEN Pas seul!

(He wheels Kitty into Lynch's arm's, snatches up his ashplant from the table and takes the floor. All wheel, whirl, waltz, twirl. Bloombella, Kittylynch, Florryzoe, jujuby women. Stephen with hat ashplant frogsplits in middle highkicks with skykicking mouth shut hand clasp part under thigh, with clang tinkle boomhammer tallyho horn blower blue green yellow flashes. Toft's cumbersome turns with hobbyhorse riders from gilded snakes dangled, bowels fandango leaping spurn soil foot and fall again.)

THE PIANOLA

Though she's a factory lass
And wears no fancy clothes.


(Closeclutched swift swifter with glareblareflare scudding they scotlootshoot lumbering by. Baraabum!)

TUTTI Encore! Bis! Bravo! Encore!

SIMON Think of your mother's people!

STEPHEN Dance of death.

(Bang fresh barang bang of lacquey's bell, horse, nag, steer piglings, Conmee on Christass lame crutch and leg sailor in cockboat armfolded ropepulling hitching stamp hornpipe' through and through, Baraabum! On nags, hogs, bellhorses, Gadarene swine, Corny in coffin. Steel shark stone one handled Nelson, two trickies Frauenzimmer plumstained from pram falling bawling. Gum, he's a champion. Fuseblue peer from barrel rev. evensong love on hackney jaunt Blazes blind coddoubled bicyclers Dilly with snowcake no fancy clothes. Then in last wiswitchback lumbering up and down bump mash tub sort of viceroy and reine relish for tublumber bumpshire rose. Baraabum!)

(The couples fall aside. Stephen whirls giddily. Room whirls back. Eyes closed, he totters. Red rails fly spacewards. Stars all around suns turn roundabout. Bright midges dance on wall. He stops dead.)

STEPHEN Ho!

(Stephen's mother, emaciated, rises stark through the floor in leper grey with a wreath of faded orange blossoms and a torn bridal veil, her face worn and noseless, green with grave mould. Her hair is scant and lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. A choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly.)

THE CHOIR

Liliata rutilantium te confessorum...
Iubilantium te virginum...


(From the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)


BUCK MULLIGAN She's beastly dead. The pity of it! Mulligan meets the afflicted mother. (He upturns his eyes.) Mercurial Malachi.


THE MOTHER (With the subtle smile of death's madness.) I was once the beautiful May Goulding. I am dead.


STEPHEN (Horrorstruck.) Lemur, who are you? What bogey man's trick is this?


BUCK MULLIGAN (Shakes his curling capbell.) The mockery of it! Kinch killed her dogsbody bitchbody. She kicked the bucket. (Tears of molten butter fall from his eyes into the scone.) Our great sweet mother! Epi oinopa ponton.


THE MOTHER (Comes nearer, breathing upon him softly her breath of wetted ashes.) All must go through it, Stephen. More women than men in the world. You too. Time will come.


STEPHEN (Choking with fright, remorse and horror.) They said I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.


THE MOTHER (A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth.) You sang that song to me. Love's bitter mystery.


STEPHEN (Eagerly.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word known to all men.


THE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.


STEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!


THE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brain work. Years and years I loved you, O my son, my firstborn, when you lay in my womb.


ZOE (Fanning herself with the grate fan.) I'm melting!


FLORRY (Points to Stephen) Look! He's white.


BLOOM (Goes to the window to open it more.) Giddy.


THE MOTHER (With smouldering eyes.) Repent! O, the fire of hell!


STEPHEN (Panting.) The corpsechewer! Raw head and bloody bones!


THE MOTHER (Her face drawing near and nearer, sending out an ashen breath.) Beware! (She raises her blackened, withered right arm slowly towards Stephen's breast with outstretched fingers.) Beware! God's hand! (A green crab with malignant red eyes sticks deep its grinning claws in Stephen's heart.)


STEPHEN (Strangled with rage.) Shite! (His features grow drawn and grey and old.)


BLOOM (At the window.) What?


STEPHEN Ah non, par exemple! The intellectual imagination! With me all or not at all. Non serviam!


FLORRY Give him some cold water. Wait. (She rushes out.)


THE MOTHER (Wrings her hands slowly, moaning desperately.) O Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on him! Save him from hell, O divine Sacred Heart!


STEPHEN No! No! No! Break my spirit all of you if you can! I'll bring you all to heel!


THE MOTHER (In the agony of her deathrattle.) Have mercy on Stephen, Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love, grief and agony on Mount Calvary.


STEPHEN Nothung!


(He hits his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier. Time's livid final flame leaps and, in the following darkness, ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry.)


THE GASJET Pwfungg!


BLOOM Stop!


LYNCH (Rushes forward and seizes Stephen's hand.) Here! Hold on! Don't run amok!


BELLA Police!


(Stephen, abandoning his ashplant, his head and arms thrown back stark, beats the ground and flees from the room past the whores at the door.)
BELLA (Screams.) After him!


(The two whores rush to the halldoors. Lynch and Kitty and Zoe stampede from the room. They talk excitedly. Bloom follows, returns.)


THE WHORES (Jammed in the doorway, pointing.) Down there.


ZOE (Pointing.) There. There's something up.


BELLA Who pays for the lamp? (She seizes Bloom's coattail.) There. You were with him. The lamp's broken.


BLOOM (Rushes to the hall, rushes back.) What lamp, woman?


A WHORE He tore his coat.


BELLA (Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.) Who's to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.


BLOOM (Snatches up Stephen's ashplant.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...


BELLA (Loudly.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A ten shilling house.


BLOOM (His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.) Only the chimney's broken. Here is all he...


BELLA (Shrinks back and screams.) Jesus! Don't!


BLOOM (Warding off a blow.) To show you how he hit the paper. There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!


FLORRY (With a glass of water enters.) Where is he?


BELLA Do you want me to call the police?


BLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student. Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (He makes a masonic sign.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don't want a scandal.


BELLA (Angrily.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he? I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (She shouts.) Zoe! Zoe!


BLOOM (Urgently.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (Warningly.) I know.


BELLA (Almost speechless.) Who are you incog?


ZOE (In the doorway.) There's a row on.


BLOOM What? Where? (He throws a shilling on the table and shouts.) That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers. After him, freshfound, the hue and cry zigzag gallops in hot pursuit of follow my leader: 65 C 66 C night watch, John Henry Menton, Wisdom Hely, V.B.

THE HUE AND CRY (Helterskelterelterwelter) He's Bloom! Stop Bloom! Stopabloom! Stopperrobber! Hi! Hi! Stop him on the corner!


(At the corner of Beaver Street beneath the scaffolding Bloom panting stops on the fringe of the noisy quarrelling knot, a lot not knowing a jot what hi! hi! row and wrangle round the whowhat brawlaltogether.)


STEPHEN (With elaborate gestures, breathing deeply and slowly.) You are my guests. The uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.


PRIVATE CARR (To Cissy Caffrey.) Was he insulting you?


STEPHEN Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter. Ungenitive.
VOICES No, he didn't. The girl's telling lies. He was in Mrs Cohen's. What's up? Soldiers and civilians.


CISSY CAFFREY I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to do - you know and the young man ran up behind me. But I'm faithful to the man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.


STEPHEN (Catches sight of Kitty's and Lynch's heads.) Hail, Sisyphus. (He points to himself and the others.) Poetic. Neopoetic.


VOICES She's faithfultheman.


CISSY CAFFREY Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.


PRIVATE COMPTON He doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter. Biff him one, Harry.


PRIVATE CARR (To Cissy.) Was he insulting you while me and him was having a piss?


LORD TENNYSON (In Union Jack blazer and cricket flannels, bareheaded, flowingbearded.) Their's not to reason why.


PRIVATE COMPTON Biff him, Harry.


STEPHEN (To Private Compton. ) I don't know your name but you are quite right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.


CISSY CAFFREY (To the crowd.) No, I was with the private.


STEPHEN (Amiably.) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every lady for example...


PRIVATE CARR (His cap awry, advancing to Stephen.) Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?


STEPHEN (Looks up in the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand) Hand hurts me slightly. Enfin, ce sont vos oignons.


(To Cissy Caffrey.) Some trouble is on here. What is it, precisely?


DOLLY GRAY (From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign of the heroine of Jericho.) Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.


(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)


BLOOM (Elbowing through the crowd plucks Stephen's sleeve vigorously.) Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.


STEPHEN (Turns.) Eh? (He disengages himself) Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He points his finger.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.


(He staggers a pace back.)


BLOOM (Propping him.) Retain your own.


STEPHEN (Laughs emptily.) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his brow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.


BIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor out of the college.


CUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.


BIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.


CUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.


PRIVATE CARR (Pulls himself free and comes forward.) What's that you're saying about my king?


(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns' horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed: Défense d'uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)


EDWARD THE SEVENTH (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) Peace, perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns to his subjects.) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a back.


(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously in acknowledgement.)


PRIVATE CARR (To Stephen.) Say it again.


STEPHEN (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) I understand your point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the point. You die for your country, suppose. (He places his arm on Private Carr's sleeve.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it to die. Damn death. Long live life!


EDWARD THE SEVENTH (Levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)


My methods are new and are causing surprise.
To make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.


STEPHEN Kings and unicorns! (He falls back a pace.) Come somewhere and we'll... What was that girl saying?...

PRIVATE COMPTON Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one into Jerry.

BLOOM (To the privates, softly.) He doesn't know what he's saying. Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster. I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.

STEPHEN (Nods, smiling and laughing.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.

PRIVATE CARR I don't give a bugger who he is. PRIVATE COMPTON We don't give a bugger who he is.

STEPHEN I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.

(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day boys hat signs to Stephen.)

KEVIN EGAN H'lo. Bonjour! The vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes.

(Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbit face nibbling a quince leaf.)

PATRICE Socialiste!

DON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY (In medieval hauberk, two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a mailed hand against the privates.) Were those eykes to footboden, big grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!

BLOOM (To Stephen.) Come home. You'll get into trouble.

STEPHEN (Swaying.) I don't avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.

BIDDY THE CLAP One immediately observes that he is of patrician lineage.

THE VIRAGO Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.

THE BAWD The red's as good as the green, and better. Up the soldiers! Up King Edward!

A ROUGH (Laughs.) Ay! Hands up to De Wet.

THE CITIZEN (With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)

May the God above
Send down a cove
With teeth as sharp as razors
To slit the throat
Of the English dogs
That hanged our Irish leaders.


THE CROPPY BOY (The rope noose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands.)

I bear no hate to a living thing,
But love my country beyond the king.


RUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER (Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with a gladstone bag which he opens.) Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved from the body of Miss Barrow which sent Seddon to the gallows.

(He jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently.)

THE CROPPY BOY Horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.

(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)

RUMBOLD I'm near it myself. (He undoes the noose.) Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time as applied to His Royal Highness. (He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!

EDWARD THE SEVENTH (Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket and sings with soft contentment.)

On coronation day, on coronation day,
O, Won't We have a merry time,
Drinking whisky, beer and wine!


PRIVATE CARR Here. What are you saying about my king?

STEPHEN (Throws up his hands.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (He searches his pockets vaguely.) Gave it to someone.

PRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?

STEPHEN (Tries to move off.) Will some one tell me where I am least likely to meet these necessary evils? ça se voit aussi à Paris. Not that I... But by Saint Patrick!...

(The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.)

STEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats her farrow!

OLD GUMMY GRANNY (Rocking to and fro.) Ireland's sweetheart, the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them! (She keens with banshee woe.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She wails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?

STEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.

CISSY CAFFREY (Shrill.) Stop them from fighting!

A ROUGH Our men retreated.

PRIVATE CARR (Tugging at his belt.) I'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.

BLOOM (Terrified.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.

THE CITIZEN Erin go bragh!

(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility.)

PRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.

STEPHEN Did I? When?

BLOOM (To the redcoats.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our monarch.

THE NAVVY (Staggering past.) O, yes. O, God, yes! O, make the kwawr a krowawr! O! Bo!

(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spear points. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. He gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)

MAJOR TWEEDY (Growls gruffly.) Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and at them! Mahal shalal hashbaz.

PRIVATE CARR I'll do him in.

PRIVATE COMPTON (Waves the crowd back.) Fair play, here. Make a bleeding butcher's shop of the bugger.

(Massed bands blare Garryowen and God save the king.)

CISSY CAFFREY They're going to fight. For me!

CUNTY KATE The brave and the fair.

BIDDY THE CLAP Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.

CUNTY KATE (Blushing deeply.) Nay, Madam. The gules doublet and merry Saint George for me!

STEPHEN The harlot's cry from street to street Shall weave old Ireland's windingsheet.

PRIVATE CARR (Loosening his belt, shouts.) I'll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.

BLOOM (Shakes Cissy Caffrey's shoulders.) Speak, you! Are you struck dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman, sacred lifegiver.

CISSY CAFFREY (Alarmed seizes Private Carr's sleeve.) Amn't I with you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. (She cries.) Police!

STEPHEN (Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey.)

White thy fambles, red thy gan
And thy quarrons dainty is.


VOICES Police!

DISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!

(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny, lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C. Haines love MA. in a plain cassock and mortar board, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrants head an open umbrella.)

FATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN Introibo ad altare diaboli.

THE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE To the devil which hath made glad my young days.

FATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN (Takes from the chalice and elevates a blooddripping host.) Corpus Meum.

THE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE (Raises high behind the celebrant's petticoats, revealing his grey bare hairy buttocks between which a carrot is stuck.) My body.

THE VOICE OF ALL THE DAMNED Htengier Tnetopinmo Dog Drol eht rot, Aiulella!

(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)

ADONAI Dooooooooooog!

THE VOICE OF ALL THE BLESSED Alleluia, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth!

(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)

ADONAI Goooooooooood!

(In strident discord peasants and townsmen of mange and Green factions sing Kick the Pope and Daily, daily sing to Mary.)

PRIVATE CARR (With ferocious articulation.) I'll do him in, so help me fucking Christ! I'll wring the bastard fucker's bleeding blasted fucking windpipe!

OLD GUMMY GRANNY (Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand.) Remove him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (She prays.) O good God, take him!

BLOOM (Runs to Lynch.) Can't you get him away?

LYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (To Bloom.) Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (He drags Kitty away.)

STEPHEN (Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit.

BLOOM (Runs to Stephen.) Come along with me now before worse happens. Here's your stick.

STEPHEN Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.

CISSY CAFFREY (Pulling Private Carr.) Come on, you're boosed. He insulted me but I forgive him. (Shouting in his ear.) I forgive him for insulting me.

BLOOM (Over Stephen's shoulder.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.

PRIVATE CARR (Breaks loose.) I'll insult him.

(He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it up.)

MAJOR TWEEDY (Loudly.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!

THE RETRIEVER (Barking furiously.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.

THE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's fainted!

(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)

What call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence? Let them go and fight the Boers!

THE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.

(They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit.)

THE RETRIEVER (Barking.) Wow wow wow.

BLOOM (Shoves them back, loudly.) Get back, stand back!

PRIVATE COMPTON (Tugging his comrade.) Here bugger off, Harry. There's the cops!

(Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group)

FIRST WATCH What's wrong here?

PRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted my chum. (The retriever barks.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?

CISSY CAFFREY (With expectation.) Is he bleeding?

A MAN (Rising from his knees.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all right.

BLOOM (Glances sharply at the man.) Leave him to me. I can easily...

SECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?

PRIVATE CARR (Lurches towards the watch.) He insulted my lady friend.

BLOOM (Angrily.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness. Constable, take his regimental number.

SECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. PRIVATE COMPTON (Pulling his comrade.) Here, bugger off, Harry. Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.

PRIVATE CARR (Staggering as he is pulled away.) God fuck old Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.

FIRST WATCH (Taking out his notebook.) What's his name?

BLOOM (Peering over the crowd.) I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant.

FIRST WATCH Name and address.

(Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)

BLOOM (Quickly.) O, the very man! (He whispers.) Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.

SECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.

CORNY KELLEHER (To the watch, with drawling eye.) That's all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (He laughs.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?

FIRST WATCH (Turns to the crowd.) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.

(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)

CORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (He laughs, shaking his head.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?

FIRST WATCH (Laughs.) I suppose so.

CORNY KELLEHER (Nudges the second watch.) Come and wipe your name off the slate. (He lilts, wagging his head.) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?

SECOND WATCH (Genially.) Ah, sure we were too.

CORNY KELLEHER (Winking.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.

SECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.

CORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.

BLOOM (Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) Thank you very much gentlemen, thank you. (He mumbles confidentially.) We don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.

FIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.

SECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.

FIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to report it at the station.

BLOOM (Nods rapidly.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.

SECOND WATCH It's our duty.

CORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.

THE WATCH (Saluting together.) Night, gentlemen. (They move off with slow heavy tread.)

BLOOM (Blows.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?.

CORNY KELLEHER (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.

BLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...

CORNY KELLEHER (Laughs.) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!

BLOOM (Tries to laugh.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...

(The horse neighs.)

THE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!

CORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?

BLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.

(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.)

CORNY KELLEHER (Scratches his nape.) Sandycove! (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) Eh! (He calls again.) Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.

BLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.

CORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. (He laughs.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!

THE HORSE (Neighs.) Hohohohohome.

BLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...

(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)

CORNY KELLEHER (From the car, standing.) Night.

BLOOM Night.

(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)

BLOOM Eh! Ho! (There is no answer he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!

STEPHEN (Groans.) Who? Black panther vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) Who... drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...

(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)

BLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the wood shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What!

(Murmurs.)

... shadows... the woods
... white breast... dim...


(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and form.)

BLOOM (Communes with the night.) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (He murmurs.)... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... (He murmurs.) in the rough sands of the sea. a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...

(Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)

BLOOM (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) Rudy!

RUDY (Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

[Verse One] [Torae]
Yo, this be unorthodox
Dunn awesome ock
Niggas ain't on they job
Dumb off the clock
I'm all on my watch
Y'all all have to watch
How I made niggas run into a halt and stop
Hot
Scorchin' mic devices
Nice since, Morgan Freeman got his driver's license
Niggas bars aight, but really that hype shit
Is Torae, Phonte, Big Pooh and Khrysis
Whoop whoop is the sound of the po po
But the sound of my vocals, sound like a choke hold
All over these so called
Niggas that's so dope
Nigga you about as hot as a snow cone
(You so gone)
Your monic is monic go way about your head like yamakas
I'm fire everyday like it's Chanukah
Thermometer monitor
Meteoric measurer barometer
Rhymin' niggas don't wanna follow, huh
The Donald Goines of flowin'
Cause when I pen it, I go when I'm heartless/Hart less
Like the brothers of Owen
I already got it done I'm just keepin' it goin'
This is grown folk talk
Youngin' speak when you spoken
Hopin' the hopeless note these bars that I wrote
If you devote your focus you could come as dope as this
This track's atrocious
The verses too
Cause we got Khrysis on the board like he's surfin' dude
[Phonte talking]
Yeah, it's Little Brother. My nigga Khrysis on the beat. My nigga Tor
Let's show these niggas what MCin' sounds like man

[Phonte]
Ayo, get on the mic spit a couple of verses
Make niggas give it up like ""What the fuck is my purpose?
Cause he's such an elaborate wordsmith.""
Phon-teezy
Spit greezy like a bucket of churches
Three piece
These streets wanna see what I'm workin' with
So you Ringling niggas can stop that Circus shit
Y'all got hip hop soundin' like kids-bop
So I'm gonna murk these tracks like Berkowitz
The Son Of Samuel, watch me surface with
A new rhyme that make y'all wack niggas call time out
Let's talk real shit
If you can't feel this
You sniffin' that Lohan or smokin' that Winehouse
I'm on the grind now
Just tryin' to find out
If y'all niggas really gonna waste your time
Takin' shots at Phonte, wastin' all your rhymes
Wanna step to the kid, you done lost your mind
I'll do your school of thought like Columbine
Can't stay there in Virginia Tech all combined
I'm a Reservoir Dog like Harvey Kei....
Tell the truth when most niggas will hardly drop
When I roll through the 'Boro they say, ""Phonte home.""
When I spit that hard shit they say, ""Phonte wrong.""
Sang a hook, they be like, ""Uww, that's Phonte's song.""
24 bars, it's over nigga, Phonte gone
Like uh uh on
[Verse Three] [Big Pooh]
Hear ye hear ye, come one come all
Niggas pray and pray on my downfall
I can get knocked down, be back tomorrow
Pooh still looks fresh, no scrapes or scars
Get on my Suge Knight, puff on a cigar
Or my Tracy Chapman, this is my guitar
And my best so far, continues to be light years and your sub par
Like if we both box, with me you couldn't spar
Be who you are, that's lame my nig
I'mma be who I am, won't change for shit
Greatest in my hands with a hell of a grip
Don't quit your day job, that's a hell of a tip
Kind of funny finding you on mine, don't trip
I write rhymes daily
Records come yearly
Got to make sure all my people gon' hear me
Told y'all sincerely, I won't quit
Triumph in my words, every line I spit
Jim Crow wack niggas, to the back you sit
It's Rapper Big Pooh, small minds don't fit
Tell 'em H.O.J. is the crew I'm with
Bull City down here, better come meet quick
Even on black ice, won't see me slip
Put the pressure on niggas, make 'em all submit

Spinning through the lives of the people you know
We all slow down

How you gonna keep from turnin' your life away?
No days you can borrow, no time you can buy
No trust in tomorrow, it's a lie

My sky shoes are spiked with lead heels
I'm lost in this star car I'm drivin'
But my air sole keeps pushin' big wheels
My world is a constant confusion
My mind is prepared to attack
My past, a persuasive illusion
I'm watchin' the future it's black

What do you know? You know just what you perceive
What can you show? Nothing of what you believe
And as you grow, each thread of life that you leave
Will spin around your deeds and dictate your needs
As you sell your soul and you sow your seeds
And you wound yourself and your loved one bleeds
And your habits grow, and your conscience feeds
On all that you thought you should be
I never thought this could happen to me

I feel like a spinning top or a dreidel
The spinnin' don't stop when you leave the cradle
You just slow down
Round and around this world you go
Spinnin' through the lives of the people you know

Can I interest you in Hanukkah?
Maybe something in a Festival of Lights
It's a sensible alternative to Christmas
And it lasts for seven--for you--eight nights

[Stephen Colbert]
Hanukkah, huh?
I've never really thought about it

[Jon Stewart]
Well‚ you could do worse

[Stephen Colbert]
Is it merry?

[Jon Stewart]
It's kind of merry

[Stephen Colbert]
Is it cheery?

[Jon Stewart]
It's got some cheer

[Stephen Colbert]
Is it jolly?
[Jon Stewart]
Look‚ I wouldn't know from jolly
But it's not my least unfavorite time of year

[Stephen Colbert]
When's it start?

[Jon Stewart]
The 25th

[Stephen Colbert]
Of December?

[Jon Stewart]
Kislev

[Stephen Colbert]
Which is when exactly?

[Jon Stewart]
I will check

[Stephen Colbert]
Are there presents?

[Jon Stewart]
Yes‚ indeed, 8 days of presents
Which means one nice one, then a week of dreck
[Stephen Colbert]
Does Hanukkah commemorate
Events profound and holy?
A king who came to save the world?

[Jon Stewart]
No‚ oil that burned quite slowly

[Stephen Colbert]
Well, it sounds fantastic!

[Jon Stewart]
There's more!

We have latkes

[Stephen Colbert]
What are they?

[Jon Stewart]
Potato pancakes

We have dreidels

[Stephen Colbert]
What are they?
[Jon Stewart]
Wooden tops

We have candles

[Stephen Colbert]
What are-

[Jon Stewart]
THEY ARE CANDLES!
And when we light them
Oh the fun it never stops

What do you say, Stephen
Do you want to give Hanukkah a try?

[Stephen Colbert]
I'm trying to see me as a Jew
I'm trying even harder
But I believe in Jesus Christ
So it's a real non-starter

[Jon Stewart]
I can't interest you in Hanukkah?
Just a little bit?

[Stephen Colbert]
No thanks‚ I'll pass
I'll keep Jesus
You keep your potato pancakes
But I hope that you enjoy 'em
On behalf of all the goyim

[Jon Stewart]
Be sure to tell the Pontiff
My people say ""gut yontif""

[Stephen Colbert]
That's exactly what I'll do

[Both]
Happy holidays, you

[Jon Stewart]
Too!

[Stephen Colbert]
Jew!

You’ve got the nose
You’ve got the name
The name is Steinstein

I’m not sure what you want me to do
But I think this is
Worth working through
I’ll admit it’s a little bit
Out of the blue
But, might as well try I think
I could be Jewish for you

Like on the holidays…

I’ll stop baking gingerbread
Start baking Challah
When Hanukkah comes, heck
I’ll light the mandala!
Menorah, excuse me
If you could just choose me
I’ll sing eidledeidle not fa la
Yeah as far as the culture
I might need a clue
But I’ll give it a shot, ‘cause
I’ve got to be Jewish for you
I’ll go with you to temple
I’ll try to learn Yiddish
I’ll start eating Kosher
I’ll even play quidditch!
Nope, that’s not a Jew thing
Well teach me some new things
I won’t be the slightest bit skittish
I’ll do it by rote till
It feels like it’s true
And till I’m verklempt I’ll
Attempt to be Jewish for you

I mean
I would be Irish, or Russian or French
But, no, Chinese is a bit of a stretch
Um, just wait, even your Rabbi
Will call me a mensch
Did I mention I’ve been
Practising my kvetch?!
Oh! I will adapt where
The av’rage girl freezes
Cos if I have to have the

I’ll do it with Jesus

Learn to like latkes!
And if we have sons they’ll
All have Bar Matzahs!
Bar Mitzvahs I’m joking!
I promise I know things
Enough not to ruin chbotkas
If that’s what it takes then
That’s what I’ll do
Please don’t run away and one day
I’ll be Jewish for you

Tell me
You’ve never questioned
One holy command
Tell me
Don’t you think love’s
More romantic unplanned?
Just tell me you’re nervous
We'll start with the service
Just tell me where you stand
Tell me “I need you!”
Tell me in Hebrew!
Teach me Lechayim and Horcrux and Oy
Just tell me why
Instead of hi, I’ll say shalom
Till my hovel feels like home
But I won’t say goodbye
So here’s what I propose:
I’ll read through the Torah
From cover to cover
Till even Moses could see
We were meant for each other
You know I adore you
So let me fight for you
Together we’ll take on your mother

It might be a prayer
But a prayer can come true
I dare you to dare me
I swear I’ll come through
But I’m with you and there
Isn’t a thing I can’t do
So if you’re inclined
I won’t mind
Being Jewish for you6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Okay...
This is a song that uhh...
There's a lot of Christmas songs out there and uhh...
Not too many Chanukah songs
So uhh...
I wrote a song for all those nice little Jewish kids who don't get to hear any Chanukah songs
Here we go...

[Chorus]
Put on your yarmulke
Here comes Chanukah
So much fun-ukah
To celebrate Chanukah

[Pre-Verse]
Chanukah is the festival of lights
Instead of one day of presents, we have eight crazy nights
When you feel like the only kid in town without a Christmas tree
Here's a list of people who are Jewish just like you and me

[Verse 1]
David Lee Roth lights the menorah
So do James Caan, Kirk Douglas, and the late Dinah Shore-ah
Guess who eats together at the Carnegie Deli
Bowser from Sha Na Na and Arthur Fonzerelli
Paul Newman's half Jewish, Goldie Hawn's half too
Put them together, what a fine lookin' Jew
You don't need ""Deck The Halls"" or ""Jingle Bell Rock""
'Cause you can spin a dreidel with Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock—both Jewish
[Chorus]
Put on your yarmulke
It's time for Chanukah
The owner of the Seattle Supersonic-ahs
Celebrates Chanukah

[Verse 2]
O.J. Simpson, not a Jew
But guess who is? Hall of Famer Rod Carew—he converted
We got Ann Landers and her sister Dear Abby
Harrison Ford's a quarter Jewish—not too shabby
Some people think that Ebenezer Scrooge is
Well he's not, but guess who is
All Three Stooges!
So many Jews are in showbiz
Tom Cruise isn't, but I heard his agent is

[Chorus]
Tell your friend Veronica
It's time to celebrate Chanukah
I hope I get a harmonica
Oh this lovely, lovely Chanukah
So drink your gin and tonic-ah
And smoke your marijuana-kah
If you really, really wanna-kah
Have a happy, happy, happy, happy Chanukah
Happy Chanukah2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Many nations of antiquity made use of the letters of their alphabets as substitutes for any independent signs to typify numerical conceptions. It is with the Hebrew letters as numerals that we are chiefly concerned, and to a smaller extent with the Greek. Ancient records show that the Greeks used their numbers almost exclusively for everyday purposes; while the Jewish Rabbis added to their practical value special peculiar purposes, and looked to them to furnish deeper views of nature, existence and doctrine. No doubt can exist that the ancient Egyptians were fully aware of the wondrous mysteries which numbers are able to disclose, so, considering that Greece, and neither Judea nor Babylon, succeeded to the empires of ancient Egypt, it is a curious fact how little knowledge of the dogmas of the Hierophants of Sais, Memphis and Thebes Greek literature has transmitted to us.

The Jewish Rabbis discovered so much of interest and importance behind the merely superficial value of numbers, and of words as their representatives, that they gradually developed a complete science of numerical conceptions apart from mathematics; this took the name of Kabalah or Qabalah, Cabbala, or even Cabala, words variously misspelt from Qblh—the Received doctrine, from the root Qbl, meaning to Receive.

The Greeks as aforesaid did not develop nor use their letters as numbers for mental conceptions, yet in the Middle

p. 23

[paragraph continues] Ages we often find Greek letters used to transliterate Hebrew similars, and so there was formed a bastard Greek Kabalah on the Hebrew type.

It must be constantly borne in mind that all Hebrew words or numbers are read from right to left, or the reverse of English words; but in their English transliteration they are here in English order.

The corresponding numerals, Greek and Hebrew letters, are here given with their English names, and the English synonymous letters are also added.

Note that there were no proper Greek Letters for 6, 90, and 900, so they used special symbols—episemon (vau, or bau, digamma) for 6; koppa for 90; and sanpi for 900—ς ϙ Ϡ).

At some periods the five finals were not used for the hundreds, but instead Tau was written for 400 and other hundreds added; thus 500 was TQ. Another point of importance is that the Jews never write JH Jah for 15, because it is a Deity title, they use instead 9, 6 thus TV, teth vau. The Kabalists used JH only when they desired to call attention to the Holy Name in the number.

In certain Kabalistic numerical computations many Rabbis deemed it permissible to add an Aleph, one, and this they called the Colel.

In some cases we find the Greeks to have used their letters in direct order for purposes of numeration, as may be seen in some copies of very old poems (the 24 books of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, for example), in which the stanzas bear the letters consecutively, in a similar manner to the Hebrew letters heading the portions of the 119th Psalm in our Bibles.

The word Kabalah includes the Hebrew Doctrines of Cosmogony and Theology as well as the Science of

p. 25

[paragraph continues] Numbers. The former is specified as the Dogmatic Kabalah, the latter as the Literal Kabalah.

By means of associating the ancient doctrines of Numbers with the letters of the alphabet, the Planets, Stars, Zodiacal signs and other astronomical terms, a form of divination became practised, by which the professors attempted to foretell the future, life and death, good and evil Fortune, detection of theft, etc., an ample explanation of which may be studied by the curious in the ""Holy Guide"" of John Heydon.

With this system is associated the practice of pure Astrology, the divination of Fate by means of the Heavenly bodies, especially the formation of the so-called Horoscopes—schemes of the arrangement of the Planets at the moment of Birth, from which all the important phases of the life can be inferred—by some few persons. The Kabalah became a means of handing down from one generation to another hidden truths, religious notions, secrets of nature, ideas of Cosmogony, and facts of history, in a form which was unintelligible to the uninitiated; and the revealing of the secrets, and the methods of interpretation were veiled in mystery, and only to be approached through Religion.

The more practical part of the system was involved in the three processes of:—

Gematria, Notaricon, and Temura.

Gematria, a method depending on the fact that each Hebrew letter had a numerical value. When the sum of the numbers of the letters composing a word was the same as the sum of the letters of another word, however different, they perceived an analogy between them, and considered them to have a necessary connection. Thus certain numbers got to be well known as meaning certain things; and not words only, but sentences were treated in this manner; thus, as an example referring to Genesis xviii. v. 2, we find the words, ""and lo, three men,"" Vehennah, shalisha, Vhnh Shlshh; this set down in numbers becomes 6, 5, 50, 5, 300, 30, 300, 5, which amount to 701: now the words, ""these are Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael,""

p. 26

[paragraph continues] ""Alu Mikhael Gabriel ve Raphael,"" ALU MIKAL GBRIAL V RPAL converted are, 1, 30, 6, 40, 10, 20, 1, 30, 3, 2, 200, 10, 1, 30, 6, 200, 80, 1, 30, also amounting to 701, and the Rabbis argued that these two sets of three beings were identical. Some Christian Kabalists point out that in Genesis xlix. v. 10 we find ""Yebah Shiloh,"" YBA SHILH, ""Shiloh shall come,"" which amount to 358; and that the word ""Messiah,"" MShVCh is 40, 300, to, 8, or 358; but so is also Nachash, the Serpent of Moses, NChSh, 50, 8, 300; and I must remark that the claim to translate ShILh, or, as some ancient Hebrew MSS. write it, ShLh, by ""Shiloh,"" in the sense of Jesus Christ, is far-fetched. The word is simply ""rest,"" or ""peace,"" in its simplest meaning, but also is the Scorpio of the Chaldean zodiac (related to Nachash, serpent); and ""Judah,"" of whom Jacob is talking in the prophecy, is the sign of the zodiac; Leo for ""Judah is a lion's whelp"" (the Chaldean zodiac has a lion couchant), ""he crouches as a lion."" In this sense, then, ""the sceptre shall not depart from Judah,"" i.e., power shall not leave Leo, until Shelah, Shiloh or Scorpio shall come up or rise. Astronomy teaches that as Leo passes away from the meridian, Scorpio rises. The title ""Comforter,"" ""Menachem,"" MNChM, 40, 50, 8, 40, amounting to 138, and the title ""The Branch,"" applied to the Messiah in Zechariah iii. v. 8, namely, TzMCh, 90, 40, 8, also 138, are of the same number. Metatron, the great angel MThRThN, and ShADDAI ShDI, translated ""Almighty,"" are both 314. The letter Shin, Sh, = 300, is used as a glyph of ""the spirit of the living gods,"" Ruach Elohim RUCh ALhIM, which transmutes into 200, 6, 8, 1, 30, 5, 10, 40, or 300.

The Kabalists sometimes considered the units to refer to Divine Beings, the tens to celestial bodies, hundreds to things of earth, and thousands to future events.

Notaricon, a word derived from the Latin notarius, a shorthand writer, means the construction of a word from the initial or final letters of the several words of a sentence; or vice versa the construction of a sentence of which each word

p. 27

in order begins with the several letters composing a given word: processes of contraction and expansion, therefore.

Refer to Deuteronomy xxx. V. 12, and find that Moses asks, ""Who shall go up for us to heaven?"" the initials of the words of the sentence, MY YOLh LNU HShMYMH, read ""My yeolah lenu hashemimha,"" form the word MYLH or ""Mylah,"" which means ""Circumcision,"" and the final letters form the word Jehovah, YHUH or IHVH, suggesting that Jehovah pointed out the way, by circumcision, to heaven. Again the first six letters of the book of Genesis, BRAShIT, Berasit, translated ""In the beginning,"" but more properly ""In wisdom,"" are the initials of the words BRAShIT RAH ALHIM ShYQBLU IShRAL TURH, read ""Berasit rauah Elohim shyequebelu Israel torah,"" which mean ""In the beginning, God saw that Israel would accept the Law.""

The famous Rabbinic name of power, ""AGLA,"" is formed of the initials of the sentence, ""Tu potens in sæculum Domine,"" ATH GBUR LOULM ADNI, Ateh gibur loulam Adonai. The word ""Amen"" is from AMN, the initials of ""Adonai melekh namen,"" ADNI MLK NAMN, meaning ""The Lord and Faithful King.""

Temura means Permutation; sometimes the letters of a word are transposed according to certain rules, and with certain limitations; at others each letter of a word is replaced by another according to a definite scheme, forming a new word, of which permutation there are many recognised forms. For example, the alphabet of 22 letters is halved and the two sets placed one over the other in reverse order, thus:—

A

B

G

D

H

V

Z

Ch

Th

Y

K

T

Sh

R

Q

Tz

P

O

S

N

M

L

then A is changed to T, and V to P, and so on; so Babel = BBL becomes Sheshak, i.e., ShShx used by Jeremiah xxv. v. 26. This form is called Atbash or AT-BSh; it will be seen that there must be 21 other possible forms, and these were named in order, thus, Albat, Agdat, etc.; the complete set was called ""the combinations of Tziruph."" Other Permutations were named Rational, Right, Averse

p. 28

and Irregular; these are produced by forming a square and subdividing it by 21 lines in each direction into 484 smaller squares, and then writing in each square a letter in order successively from right to left, or from above down, or the reverse. The most popular mode of permutation has however been the form called ""Kabalah of the Nine Chambers,"" produced by the intersection of two horizontal and two vertical lines, forming nine spaces, a central square, and 4 three-sided figures, and 4 two-sided figures, to each of which are allotted certain letters; there are several modes even of this arrangement, and there is a mystical mode of allotting the Sephiroth to this figure, but this is a Rosicrucian secret.

This method is used in a superficial manner in Mark Master Masonry.

A further development of the Numerical Kabalah consists of arithmetical processes of Extension and Contraction; thus Tetragrammaton is considered as Y 10, H 5, V 6, H 5, or 26, but also may be spelled in full YVD 20, HA 6, VV 12, HA 6, or 44.

Again, the Kabalists extended a number by series. Zain Z or 7 becomes 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 and 7, or 28. After another manner they contracted, as 28 was equal to 2 and 8, or ro. Again, Tetragrammaton 26 became 2 and 6, or 8, so every number was reducible to a primary numeral. In this manner, within certain restrictive laws, every word had analogies with certain others; thus AB father 1 and 2 are 3, IHV Jehu 10 and 5 and 6 are 21, 2 and 1 are 3. AL ShDI, Al Shaddai, God Almighty, 1, 30, 300, 4, 10, or 345, becomes 12, and then 2 and 1 are 3; HVA or HOA 5, 6, 1, are 12, and then 3; and GDVLH Gedulah 3, 4, 6, 30, 5 are 48, and are 12 and 3.

Another method of substitution leading to results of an opposite character is the substitution in any word of similar letters of another group, hard for soft, or sibilant for dental; thus in TM = perfect, exchange Th for T, and obtain ThM, meaning defiled: ShAN, secure, tranquil, becomes SAN, battle; ShKL, wisdom, becomes SKL, foolish. In the word Shaddai, Sher, Almighty, with soft sibilant and soft

p. 29

dental is Shiddah, a wife; if we replace with a hard dental, a partial change of meaning is effected, ShThH, Sittah, an adulterous wife; both letters hardened completely change the sense, STh, Seth, a fallen man, a backslider; SThN, Satan, adversary.

I cannot, without Hebrew letters, explain well the change of sound in the Shin SH, from SH to S, but it is marked by a dot over the right or left tooth of the three teeth of the letter.

A deep mystery is concealed in the Genetic account of the conversion of the names of Abram, ABRM, into Abraham, ABRHM, and that of his wife Sarai, ShRI, into Sarah, SHRH, see Genesis xvii. v. 5–15, on the occasion of the conception of Isaac, YTZChQ or YShChQ, from the root ShChQ or TzChQ, ""laugh,"" when Sarah was 90 and Abraham 100 years old. This was on the occasion of the covenant made by Jehovah with Abram, and the institution of circumcision of males in token thereof. Now here we have the addition of an H or 5, the essentially Female Letter, to the name of Abraham, and a conversion of a Yod into He, Y into H, in the case of Sarah; and then their sterility is destroyed.

Some learned men consider Abraham to be a conversion of Brahma, the Hindoo Deity. The name splits up curiously. AB is father, BR is son, AM is like OM or AUM, a deific name of Power; RM meant ""he is lifted up."" Blavatsky remarks that Abraham and Saturn were identical in Astro-symbology; the Father of the Pharisees was Jehovah, and they were of the seed of Abraham.

The number of ABRM is 1, 2, 200, 40 or 243, the number of the man figure, Seir Anpin, representing Microprosopus.

Read Pistorius, ""Ars Cabalistica,"" for the effect of adding H 5 to men's names, see page 969; also Inman, ""Ancient Faiths,"" article Abraham; ""Secret Doctrine,"" i. 578, ii. 77; also C. W. King, ""The Gnostics.""

The name Sarah also has a curious set of similars in Hebrew—SRH, princess; SAR, flesh; SOR, gate; SChR, black; SUR, hairy seir; SRT, incision; SR and SRR, navel;

p. 30

and note the Sacti of Brahma is Sara-swati, watery; Sara refers to Sri, Lakhsmi, Aphrodite, and all are related to Water and Luna, Vach, Sophia of the Gnostics, and the ideal Holy Ghost, all feminine.

The 243 of Abram becomes 248 by adding H, and Sarai 510 becomes 505 by taking 5 off, putting H for Y, and the total of the two names is unaltered, being 753; 248 is the number of the members of Microprosopus and of RChM, rechem or Mercy.

Before leaving this subject, a reference must be made to the Magic Squares, of the Planets, etc.; to each planet belongs a special unit, and secondarily other numbers.

Thus the Square of Saturn has three compartments each way, and in each subdivision is a unit, 1 to 9, so arranged that the columns add up to 15 every way, the total being 45. The Square of Jupiter has a side of four divisions, total 16; each line adds up to 34, and the total is 136.

The Square of Mars is given here as an example, each side 5, total squares 25, each side counting 65, and total 325.

Similarly the four several numbers of Sol are 6, 36, 111, 666. Of Venus, 7, 49, 175, 1225. Of Mercury, 8, 64, 260, 2080.

Of Luna, 9, 81, 369, 3321. Each number then becomes a name. Take the case of Mercury; 64 is alike DIN and DNI, Din and Doni; 260 is Tiriel, TIRIAL; and 2080 is Taphthartharath, TPTRTRT.

Rawlinson, in his volumes on the Ancient Monarchies, states that the Chaldeans associated mystic numbers with their Deities; thus to Anu, Pluto, 60; Bel, Jupiter, 50; Hoa,

p. 31

[paragraph continues] Neptune, 40; Sin, the Moon, 30; Shamash, the Sun, 20; Nergal (Mars), 12; and Beltis or Mylitta, 15; and Nin is Saturn, 10.

It will be noticed that the great number of Sol is 666, called Sorath, SURT, the number of the Beast, about which so much folly has been written. One famous square of five times five divisions, amounting in most directions to 666, is formed of the mystic words sator, arepo, tenet, opera, rotas. Of these the first, third, and last number 666, but opera and its reverse number only 356. The number 608 is notable, being in Coptic, PhRE, the sun 500, 100, 8; and in Greek we find VHS, 400, 8, 200, which becomes IHS in Latin, for the Greek Upsilon changes to Y and I in Latin, and so we obtain the anagram of ""Iesus hominum Salvator.""

Kircher points out a Greek example of magic squares; the names Jesus and Mary, and Iesous Maria have a curious relation. Iesous is 10, 8, 200, 70, 400, 200 = 888. Now take Maria, 40, 1, 100, 10, 1 = 152. Set 152 in a Magic Square of Three, i.e., nine compartments, thus, 1—5—2, 5—2—1, 2—1—5, then the totals are all 888. The letters of Iesous also make a magic square of 36 divisions, adding every way to 888. Consult the ""Arithmologia"" of Kircher.

Remember ""illius meminit Sybilla de nomina ejus vaticinando,"" ""onoma Sou monades, dekades, ekaton tades okto,"" or ""nomen tuum 8 unitates, 8 denarii, 8 centenarii.""—See St. Augustine, De Civitate Dei.

Note the mystic word Abraxas is 1, 2, 100, 1, 60, 1, 200 = 365 in Greek letters.

As a curiosity, note that the Roman X for 10 is two V's, which are each 5; C, or, squarely drawn,  , for 100 consists of two L's which are each 50. Priscian says I for 1 was taken from i in the middle of the Greek mia, female of eis, 1, and V for 5 because it was the fifth vowel. To remember Hebrew numerals note A, I, Q = 1, 10, 100; and in Greek A, I, R, A= 1, 10, 100, 1,000.

According to ""The Canon,"" of 1897, an anonymous work,

p. 32

a Vesica piscis (the figure formed by the intersection of two equal circles) whose dimensions are 26 and 15, is a symbol of the hidden rule or canon by which Natural laws were represented to Initiates in the secret wisdom of the Ancient Mysteries. The Greek gods Zeus, Jupiter and Apollo, the Sun god, have the same numerical relation.EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Never hesitate, shorty get right to it
I know that it's her when my phone go ring
In three in the morning, it's time to cut
Sometimes she like it soft but not as much as she like it
When a nigga straight beat it up
She don't care where I put it at, long as I put it back
Deep down deep down in that puddy cat
If you ain't never had a freak-a-leak in your life
I suggest you get you one cause ain't nothin' like a

Can't even imagine who the fuck that taught her this shit
Everybody wanna know who the hot chick is

Like I'm a run and tell a nigga how to find a bitch
I might try and find a how myself, how you love that there
I keep 'em all to self, I don't like to share
Unless they determine that they into that
Being the man I am I'm a let them help their self
And just hope that I live to tell it, I'm good for that
Every now and then it's good to reflect
And think back to all the hot twat that you done hit

Now that I got a tooth, let me guess, I know everythin' you 'bout to rap 'bout
You gon' tell me since I got a tooth, you gon' run up on me and knock it back out
Well this tooth gave me courage so if you act brave and try to knock it back out and all these cameras record it
Well then fuck you I'm knockin' Smack out
Now that I got a tooth, y'all gon' like my tooth
Y'all gon' love my tooth while I'm cookin' this bitch
The funny part is I didn't pay for the shit, welfare did
But Tech 9 you gon' look at this shit
Now that I got a tooth, I swear to God I'm the truth folks
So since I fixed my priorities, I can't respect him if he only come with tooth jokes
But after this battle, his fans gon' think a lot less of you
If you think you a king I can get you jacked and have your body left full of exit wounds
I say fuck the law, I could use this Nina, but I prefer deckin' you
So just know it's no game when one of these split Tech in two (Tekken 2)
They gon' have you hooked up to an ICU with a feeding tube, breathing with no oxygen
Cause from here on (heroin) I'ma show y'all it ain't dope watchin' him
But you a fan favorite, and they praise you like it's no stoppin' him
Well you like Payton Manning cause tonight you gon' lose your cult (Colt) followin'
My niggas will let it clap for a pack if the shit ain't proper
He'll get the gat, blow out ya back if that piff ain't ganja
And if you owe my nigga money they'll chop your body parts up for six damn dollars
So keep thinkin' it's all good (Goodz) until you leave without ya hands like Hitman Holla
And you never been a main event nigga, you have never got paid more than me
That's the shit that be killin' me
You only got performance
Nigga, I got bars, creativity, flow and delivery
So when you run around sayin' you the URL champ and you got the belt
I'm thinkin' he [?] cause you like Manny Pacquiao, you gotta show us DNA to be the champ
The funniest shit is when you told Miles ""Younamsayin'? Younamsayin'?""
What this nigga think he Smack now?
Cause at that very moment Smack should've got this nigga smacked now
I got no respect for him, you a grown man who likes wrestlin'
Probably got a picture of Stone Cold in your background
That funny shit you used to do is hot, but it's wack now
So you gon' make URL hit rock bottom, cause every time you battle you bringin' SMACK down (Smackdown)
And if you fuck up my PC, then all respect is lost
These niggas will slice ya Apple with that MAC until you sketched and chalked
Docs will have him hooked up to monitors if he expect to walk
Which means y'all gonna have to get in touch with Geek Squad to give Tech support
Whatchu need protection now? Chopper knock his section down
Hitman is so much of a fraud I can't wait for this second round
X-Factor said I'll run up on Tech 9 with a TEC-9 and give Tech nine
And that shit was hot but I was confused cause
How could he run up on Tech 9 with a TEC-9 and give Tech nine if Tech 9 ain't even the real Tech N9ne?
The real Tech N9ne is from Kansas City and sold plaques on the street
This Tech N9ne is from Philly and got plaque on his teeth
The real Tech N9ne sold albums and mixtapes in each state
This Tech N9ne works at every local Philly store makin' cheese steaks
The real Tech N9ne is an underground king that created a legacy
And you just Rick Ross cause you got hot off of somebody else's identity
And if these the fraud niggas that ridin' witchu since way back
If you a fraud like Rich Ross then that only makes them Maybach
So I'll run up on your crew at the same damn time
Y'all say I got automatics well my squad got the same damn kind
If you say I stole a nigga's name you probably steal a nigga's same damn rhyme
If that nigga sniff coke he'll probably ask for the same damn line
You a bitch, you a fraud, we ain't the same damn kind
You Tech with that TEC'll die from the same damn .9
Call Rex to get that K, give him the same damn Shine
The chopper go blocka, these niggas all dyin' at the
Same damn time!
And this round, I ain't even get personal
So in that second round it's gonna get a lot worse for you
You fuckin' fraud
[Round 1: Tech 9]
Can y'all hear me?
Well aight then
You done?
Well aight then
S.P.I. two T.A.G.E
Y'all motherfuckers get it right, Wayne A.V.E
What's up NY? I'm finally back home
The king is here and I'm standin' on my throne
I normally get punks like you to hand me my wine
Fetch me my coat, this ain't a battle, this is a funeral, I'm here to engrave DNA in stone
I do my dirt dolo, can't nobody tell if you alone
To identify you, they gonna need to extract DNA from ya bones
2012 I'm here, say ""goodbye"" to all my clones
Cause there's only one 9 I'm in a class of my own
See I ain't down with all this talkin'
Fuck a conversation
Let's take these mics off and fight, I'm down for confrontation
I got a text, in other words that's confirmation
Black ya eyes, you gonna see so many stars it's like a constellation
DNA how old is you?
'Bout 19
That tooth was missin' for seven years, so that means you was 12 when that disappeared?
You think I'm funny, well I ain't tryin' to use tooth jokes to get no cheers
Whoever punched you, that's the hardest punchin' 12 year old I've ever seen in years
You said you that you was fightin' and you fucked the nigga up
Turned around for a second, then you got snuck
Either I'm hearin' this shit wrong or you just dumb as fuck
Cause my pop told me after the fights you always back up
If we'd have went to school together, I'd have DDT'd you, left ya head bleedin'
You would've got your face booked (Facebook) for crowdin' my space (Myspace) while I'm Tweetin'
Whatchu know about gettin' blowjobs while you eatin'?
Or puttin' duct tape over a bitch mouth for talkin'...while you speakin'?
See I'm not like all the other niggas you battled I'm a different type of thug
I'm not that sour nigga smokin' I'm a different type of drug
I'm that prometh' mixed with cocaine that Pimp C and Jimmy Hendrix in the cup
Throw some money in there, there's gonna be a scrimmage in this club
I can't figure out in battles why you think you so tough
Text minute you cryin', emotional, sometimes you throw up
Ask my boys I'm insane, throwed off I go nuts
Remind you of brother man from the fifth floor the way I fo' up
Your girl like Shanaynay
She's so hostile, ugly, but got a fat ass
And I swear I love them tonsils
I gas up like, ""Aye! You look like a model.""
So every time she knock on my door she on her knees like Martin when he playin' Roscoe
You can say what you wanna say and it's a battle [?]
Sticks and stones won't break my bones, I got rock skin
I'm OT with that work, in other words I put that clock in
I'm on the roof somethin' like Connect 4 the way I drop them dots in
You buy your shit week to week from the block man
I buy my shit wholesale with corn shit cause I know the crop man
My lawyer a beast in the courts, I'm like, ""Goddamn""
I could punch a cop in his mouth and get community service pickin' up rock sand
Do my two hours and later on that night meet up with 'Roxanne'
Turn on that red light, fuck her 'til her coochie Sting and that's a hot jam
All that gangsta shit you talkin'; stop fam'
That's gon make me yell to my boys ""Wild Out!"" like a Lox fan
You said your lawyer was good, he 'bout that work
But every time I turn around you back in jail, you got that T.I. curse
Before you take your gun off ya belt, I'ma squeeze mine first
Two people died, but you'll think one person died with a nickname the way I kill his grandmom and get this G mom murked
[Round 2: DNA]
Y'all wanna know what got me mad?
That slogan ""body bag""
Cause everybody that you said that you body bagged was already in a body bag
Lux puts Miles in a body bag, Miles put Rich in a body bag
2Much put X in a body bag
So if everybody you body bagged was already in a body bag then who did you really body bag?
Big T almost killed me but I jumped out the body bag
With more kicks than a karate class, a night stick and a Jabbawockeez mask
Real killers don't use evidence so what's all with the body bag?
All Smack's name is Mr. Classic nigga, not Body Bag
On my resume got four classics, one body bag
On your resume got no classics, no body bags
Know the fans wonderin' why I keep usin' slogan ""body bags""
Cause I just put that slogan ""body bags"" in a body bag
Now how the fuck you from Philly and got the blow and supposed to have the fiends itchin'
If you a Muslim that can't eat pork and your government name is Akhiym Mickens?
Akhiym, if I get the word you movin' bud and got mean piff
Since these niggas Giants when that metal lands (Meadowlands) they'll be takin' all of Akhiym's (Hakeem's ) Nicks
Akhiym, if I get the word you movin' crack ya body'll be dead on the crime scene
So for thinkin' you movin' that rock like Rock like Olajuwon you must've been high 'Keem (Hakeem)
Akhiym, if I see you overseas with [?] with green tryin' to get that green
These niggas will hit you semi when you Coming To America like Prince Akeem
Now I can keep tellin' y'all about Akhiym and Akhiym's crew
But I'd rather tell y'all some real shit that Akhiym do
Like last week I was researchin' for the battle, you know I was on Google, so I started clickin'
I found this nigga's wack ass Soundcloud page, you know me bein' the humble nigga I am I tried to give the shit a listen
After ten seconds his music was wack, I cut it off to listen to somethin' different
And that's when I seen a link for a Philadelphia rap sheet and guess who's name was on it; Akhiym Mickens
Akhiym Mickens? Now that must be some crazy shit
Cause when I scrolled down it said your age was 25 and your date of birth was 10-27-86
So I'm thinkin' it's Tech 9 the gangsta rapper, the nigga that put in work
He prolly did a homi that he ain't want us all to see
Or he prolly went and stabbed some niggas up and poked 'em so on the block he can be called a G
But when I keep scrollin' down you proved that you more of a fraud to me
Cause Tech 9, yes Tech 9 the so called gangsta rapper got arrested for altered writing and forgery
You are a fuckin' fraud and as stupid as stupid gets
But if y'all don't believe me then I'ma tell y'all the truth on how to Google it
When you go home tonight type A.K.H.I.Y.M. M.I.C.K.E.N.S. then press ""search"" you'll see Soundcloud music he uploaded for the past weeks
Skip that, all that music's wack, then go the Philadelphia rap sheet
And when y'all get there, I guarantee y'all will be applaudin' me
Cause Tech 9, yes Tech 9, the so called gangsta rapper got arrested for altered writing and forgery
Now in URL that's a charge we can't respect man
So it just proves that you a bitch that's good at bein' everybody but them self, you Mystique from X-Men
And real niggas in the hood can't support the felony
Cause you the opposite of Matt Damon, you'd rather impersonate than use your born identity (Borne Identity)
It's round two and I got 85% personal
But in that third round it's back to bars, this shit gon' get a lot worse for you
[Round 2: Tech 9]
S.P.I. two T.A.G.E
Y'all motherfuckers get it right, Wayne A.V.E
You've been on Grind Time, Time Is Money, King Of The Dot, every battle league in the fuckin' book
Which means you a fence jumper, but I'm surrounded by barb wire that'll catch ya foot
While you hangin' upside down from the gate, I lean my head with that special look
And have red all over this noodle I get spaghetti cooked
I'll pull a blade on niggas I machete crooks
Cookin' cake like Crocker I got that Betty book
I come at you sideways or straight through ya chest, like a fuckin' rook
Cause after I spit this sixteen here come the fuckin' hooks
Wayne Ave, Tech 9, T wit' a cap
Some call me Capitol
DNA, what's the code to the safe, don't make me mad at you
Gun butts to the head or I can just keep smackin' you
Or I can just duct tape Charlie Clips, for collateral
I rap fire- he ain't even come
I rap fire and spit lighter fluid that's flammable
Best game plan in the business, I can handle you
That freestylin' shit ain't gonna be good (Goodz) cause I'm The Animal
You ride around gettin' taped on niggas cause wit' the camera crew
Rare criminal, automatics I let 'em all go
Cops lookin' for me and I'm around everybody I'm like Waldo
If I'm backin' up on ya block sang that song slow
Guns New Edition so you can't 'Stand The Rain' that AR blow
Big time drug dealer; Alpo
I'm shootin' out the trunk of the car just like Malvo
Clap niggas, round of applause, I'm yellin' ""bravo""
The magazine keep on flickin' here come the slideshow
I've been fallin' back, lettin' niggas get they shit off
Now it's time to shine on you niggas
If you rap and you wack I'ma ask the crowd to yell ""time"" on you niggas
Y'all irk me, annoy me, that's why I rhyme wit' the liquor
DNA, I'ma man, you'se a boy, you prolly still get the hiccups
I thought I told y'all, niggas know I don't lolligag
But fuck it, let's get straight to the motherfuckin' body bag
X-Factor: body bag!
Yung Ill: body bag!
Big T put your body bag in a body bag
Big T, let me explain somethin' you fat fuck
You battlin' these Neon niggas I'm a Mack truck
I don't gotta talk about how I let the MAC bust
Cause I'll throw some Pacquiao jabs into that fat gut
Go 'head, act up
I've been waitin' to give ya jaw work
Ass whoopings come in all different flavors it's like a Starburst
Too make sure you piss in your pants I shoot the wall first
That Shotgun only got one shot, he better call Surf
Where you at? Where you at? Where you at? Where you at? Where you at?
You big teddy bear, guppies can't swim with the sharks, this a small surf
I ain't leavin' nobody behind I get 'em all hurt
Them yellow bananas [?]
Shots fired, when you walk out the crib you better crawl first
Money in my pocket they thinkin' I hit the jackpot
Ridin' dirty you'll never find nothin', I got the stash spots
Rock band, ride with the team, I'm talkin' Matchbox
Young bulls that stomp yo' ass out that Philly flash mob
Diamonds, aqua blue, that Listerine stuff
We get caught we don't say shit that Mr. Bean stuff
Had my youngins pickin' up shells before the D's comin'
Hot headed rappers, they see me and then they freeze up
Nigga what?!
Show me one of your best move
I've been doin' this battle rap shit since House Party and Krush Groove
Wire ya jaw, all you eat is applesauce and crushed food
I hang with the same niggas I grew up wit' cause I don't trust dudes
Nigga
Body bag!

[Round 3: DNA]
Now there's been some shit that I'm tryin' to figure out, time and time again
Oh what nigga would name himself ""9"" instead of ""10""?
But since you like nine, the minute I see you try to take what's ours
Will be the second these niggas spray clips
They'll put four in him and turn 9 to 5 like a day shift
You better watch or get clocked when I slaughter ya men
Cause I put both hands on .9 like it's a quarter to 10:00
Ya rhymes are put together all over the place, you don't design ya schemes
That's why you never get to the point 9 like a dime of green
But if I catch you in that 6, tryin' to drive and ride with sluts
I'll hit and flip it over since you like that number 9 so much
This cat pussy, my niggas will kill 9 nine times for thinkin' he got nine lives
Ironic, when the cops came they said it was odd the way 9 died
How the fuck is your name ""Tech 9"" but you ain't shootin' well?
Better yet, how the fuck is ya name Tech 9 but you need help from every other gun name in URL
Like for instance, when y'all think him vs Charlie'll be a classic, I don't respect the shit
Cause if you all know guns here's a heavy tip
Without a Clip a Tech (TEC) will never spit
Or what about when y'all say he'll kill Hollow?
I'm like ""Hell no, you need better proof.""
Cause if you all guns, a Tech (TEC) without a bullet will never shoot
So if y'all follow shit, that means Tech (TEC) needs a Hollow to shoot, now that's a Hollow tip
Alls y'all wonder why he never battled Calicoe, it wasn't cause he wasn't a good challenger
It's cause a Calicoe and a Tech (TEC) are both fire arms but a Calicoe is a higher caliber
Suge is from Jersey, he'll probably do this man greasy
So of course I'll fuck with a Shotgun over a Tech (TEC), they jam easy
Now all you do is just joke and perform
Real rappers like us ain't seein' it like-
Real rappers like us-

{Crowd loses their shit over this stumble for some reason and Smack has to ask them to ""hold it down""}

Real rappers ain't seein' it as odd, so that only shows that you chocolate drop
Just a battle rapper who's a comedian at heart
Now y'all remember that phone conversation me, Tech, Beasley and Smack had?
When you said you was a grown man and I was a kid? I thought that was fuckin' silly
Cause you from Philly and you look up to a Kid who runs your fuckin' city
Now think about it for a second, then question, ""Does he even fuck with Gilly?
Meek Milly, Beanie Sigel, Freeway, Young Gunz, I don't see you on tracks with none of 'em cuz
It looks like everybody that's famous in Philly don't be showin' you no brotherly love
Now I know, now I know everybody's wonderin'
""Why the fuck would DNA drop a blog about his tooth before the battle instead of just waitin' until today?""
But honestly I tried, but to be honest wit' y'all some people ruined the element of surprise
Now this ain't a diss and I don't wanna get URL mad
But the only people that I told that I had a tooth was the URL staff
The information got leaked out, I got tight, it was the shit I was ready to say
But I reverted back to the Yung Ill battle and realized that I shouldn't have told no one at the end of the day
Now movin' right along I'm still the truth nigga
And let's be honest Tech, niggas ain't come to this battle for me or you, they came for my tooth nigga
So before I finish wildin' out and put Tech in a bag
I'ma talk to my old tooth cause all this talk about my old tooth gettin' mad
""What's up old tooth? Nigga where you been?
The last time I seen you you got knocked down the block
I mean if you would've came back sooner I mean shit, you could've had ya spot
But for the last six years you was never wit' me and I mean honestly I'm tight you just decided to come back cause I had to waste 750
I mean I'm mad at you old tooth, you let a lot of niggas disrespect me
If you was here I would've never lost, Yung Ill would've never Duane Reade and got that dental floss
X-Factor and Quest Mcody would've never had the authority
To sit there for a third round and tell me about my priorities
I had daydreams about you tooth
I had nightmares about you tooth
Everywhere I went I thought I would see you
But since I got my new tooth and you my old tooth I'ma be honest, I don't need you
It's round three it's gettin' hot in here and if y'all know my slogan
Get Tech 9 and this old tooth the fuck outta here

{DNA throws his old tooth into the crowd}

[Round 3: Tech 9]
Can y'all hear me?
Well aight then
You done?
Well aight then
S.P.I. two T.A.G.E
Y'all motherfuckers get it right, Wayne A.V.E
Before I start this third round and we get back to it
I'd like to say rest in peace to Don Cornelius and Whitney Houston
Cause outside of this suicide case and the drugs Whitney was usin'
They did a lot of positive, powerful things for black music
Moment of silence
....
Now let me get back to this violence
Number battle rapper guns, well I got that M-16 that sound like a chainsaw growlin'
I barely finished high school, wasn't even thinkin' 'bout college
Fell in love with money and drugs, had a thing for them prize
I rap real life shit, I talk real life bars
Niggas will follow you to your crib and kill you before you park
City of Killadel' niggas get murdered where I'm from
Where it's better to have it and not need it than to get caught without one
You know how awkward it feel pickin' ya daughter up from daycare strapped?
When your shirt raise up by accident and your daughter say ""What's that?""
I almost cried when I lied all I'm speakin' is facts
I'll be damned if my mother's gon' bury another child, it's a lot of meanin' in that
'Once Again It's On' that Hov and Sigel track
This is a marathon, you start off fast and you wheezin' in the back
Catch a battle rapper back stage and leave him bleedin' in the back
Tucked a knife in my pocket then order some Cognac
You new battle rappers sprint for fame and get some change
Battle a top nigga then choke on stage
I'm from the era of Street Fighter and Streets Of Rage
Where we battled at the Chinese store to make our name
All this Twitter and social media done watered this shit down
One round battles?
If Spittage was alive he would've went 106 rounds
For $1,500 a nigga will stop whatever he doin' and pick up a pen now?
Well Smack, I'm startin' to get pissed now
Every time you say, ""Get him the fuck outta here"", pay homage to the man right here
Cause I used it for the moment, you stole it then started your career
Monkey see, monkey do, that's the one right there
Since you like to air my shit, then bite it, you disqualified, I'm knockin' Tyson out like Holyfield
They say I'ma battle a nigga from Queens and I thought about Nas
I thought about 50 Cent, shit even Hollow Don
I got a text from Beasley that read, ""DNA in March?""
I looked, slammed my iPhone down like, ""What the fuck is goin' on?""
DNA, you ugly as fuck, I just might say
I say ignorant shit like, ""Fuck you. Eat a dick. Have a nice day.""
This why I tell everybody in the world you lightweight
Cause this battle was light when Michael Jordan played in Utah
Karl Malone might've had the home court advantage but everybody came here to see Mike play
Listen boy...now I'ma freestyle champ, so I'ma do the freestyle shit
I'ma rap and punch you

{chokes}

Nah, nah, nah, nah I'm ya uncle
Listen nigga, listen nigga

{Crowd starts jeering Tech 9}

I'm ya uncle so y'all know I got that raw base
I send my nephew to the store to get more plates
Razor blades, more plates
Razor blades, more plates
I turn the block into a morgue place
I give him 30 out the long face
Get him the fuck outta here nigga!

Okay...
This is a song that uhh...
There's a lot of Christmas songs out there and uhh...
Not too many Chanukah songs
So uhh...
I wrote a song for all those nice little Jewish kids who don't get to hear any Chanukah songs
Here we go...

[Chorus]
Put on your yarmulke
Here comes Chanukah
So much fun-ukah
To celebrate Chanukah

[Pre-Verse]
Chanukah is the festival of lights
Instead of one day of presents, we have eight crazy nights
When you feel like the only kid in town without a Christmas tree
Here's a list of people who are Jewish just like you and me

[Verse 1]
David Lee Roth lights the menorah
So do James Caan, Kirk Douglas, and the late Dinah Shore-ah
Guess who eats together at the Carnegie Deli
Bowser from Sha Na Na and Arthur Fonzerelli
Paul Newman's half Jewish, Goldie Hawn's half too
Put them together, what a fine lookin' Jew
You don't need ""Deck The Halls"" or ""Jingle Bell Rock""
'Cause you can spin a dreidel with Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock—both Jewish
[Chorus]
Put on your yarmulke
It's time for Chanukah
The owner of the Seattle Supersonic-ahs
Celebrates Chanukah

[Verse 2]
O.J. Simpson, not a Jew
But guess who is? Hall of Famer Rod Carew—he converted
We got Ann Landers and her sister Dear Abby
Harrison Ford's a quarter Jewish—not too shabby
Some people think that Ebenezer Scrooge is
Well he's not, but guess who is
All Three Stooges!
So many Jews are in showbiz
Tom Cruise isn't, but I heard his agent is

[Chorus]
Tell your friend Veronica
It's time to celebrate Chanukah
I hope I get a harmonica
Oh this lovely, lovely Chanukah
So drink your gin and tonic-ah
And smoke your marijuana-kah
If you really, really wanna-kah
Have a happy, happy, happy, happy Chanukah
Happy Chanukah2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Girl, it's that special time of year
The festival of lights
But ain't no light shine brighter
Than the one in your eyes

[Chorus: Josh Peck, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Charlie Puth, Zach Braff & (All)]
Got a week and a day of love for you
This Hanukkah, girl
Got a week and a day to show you
How much I care
Got a week and a day of presents for a
Girl that shines brighter than any menorah
When you light the candles, baby
I wanna be there
(I wanna be there)

[Verse 1: Zach Braff, Josh Peck, Charlie Puth, James Corden & (Christopher Mintz-Plasse)]
Candle one
You strike the match and say the blessing
Candle two
Your sparkling eyes reflect the flame
(Candle three)
Your perfect lips sing out the prayer we're both expressing
Candle four
You make a latke and you're calling my name
[Chorus: All]
Got a week and a day of love for you
This Hanukkah, girl
Got a week and a day to show you
How much I care
When the world gets sad, our hearts will free us
Just like Judas Maccabeus
When you light the candles, baby
I wanna be there

[Verse 2: James Corden, Zach Braff, Charlie Puth, Christopher Mintz-Plasse & (Josh Peck)]
Candle five
Oh, girl, you spin me like a dreidel
Candle six
You pick me up when I fall down
(Candle seven)
Then you wrap me like a blintz and rock me like a cradle
Candle eight
Your eyes are fires that make me melt
Your lovin' is sweeter than Hanukkah gelt

[Bridge: Zach Braff, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Charlie Puth, Josh Peck & (All)]
Girl, barukh ata ado-know how you do it
Eloheinu melekh ha'o-love to be with you
Asher my life with you, b'mitzvotav
V'tzivanu l'hadlik never leave me

Got a week and a day of love for you
This Hanukkah, girl
Got a week and a day to show you
How much I care
Got a week and a day of presents for a
Girl that shines brighter than any menorah
When you light the candles, baby
I wanna be there

[Chorus: All]
Got a week and a day of love for you
This Hanukkah, girl
Got a week and a day to show you
How much I care
Our light of love will stay reflected
Eight times longer than expected
When you light the candles, baby
I wanna be there

I wanna be there

I was busy praying
At my temple in the sky
When I got an urgent message
That came straight from Adonai!

He said, ""Ida, it's your grandson
He is acting out of line
'Cause he's dating Casey Clark
Instead of dating Sarah Stein!""

I begged, ""Yahweh, send me to him!
I have wisdom to impart!
Plus my grandson Aaron loves me
And he'd never break my heart

I can make the pischer understand
The error of his ways
Even I once schtupped a schvartza
It was just a passing phase!""
[JEWISH Chorus]
Eh, the schvartza was a phase!

[GRANDMA IDA]
So listen to me, boychik
You're a mensch who's been endowed
With brains and looks and talent -
I could plotz, I'm just so proud!

But though I cut you slack
When you did not return my calls
If you wed this little tsatskeleh
I'll break your matzah balls!

I'm Casey's father. Her very disapproving
Very Christian father. And Aaron...
You are ruining my daughter's life
Never thought my baby'd be a hebrew's wife
Why would people called
""The chosen ones""
Choose to wear strange hats
And circumcise their sons?

[CHURCH CHOIR& GRANDMA IDA]
Circumcise their sons!

[CASEY'S CHRISTIAN FATHER]
You don't know the holy trinity
Or the joy felt when you trim a christmas tree

And since you cannot sing ""The first noel""
Jesus christ won't save you
From the gates of hell

[CHURCH CHOIR & GRANDMA IDA]
You'll go straight to hell!
Everyone hallelujah!

[CASEY'S CHRISTIAN FATHER]
Every angel sings for the easter bunny
And the eggs he brings

What, you don't recognize me?
I'm yours and Casey's future son
And I'm, like, beyond messed up So - thanks for that

You got me so confused
I don't know which way to choose
Do I celebrate christmas or chanukan?
Either way, I lose

'Cause I don't know what to believe in
With the mixed signals I'm receivin'
Now, I don't fit into a box
I'm strung out with doubt and I can't detox

Should I live life for the moment?
Or should I kneel and repent?
Do I believe the messiah's comin'
Or came and went?

I'm stuck and It's fuckin' depressin'
From all this perpetual guessin'
Don't mean to be preachy
But like nietzsche the nihilist
I'm thinkin' that God don't exist

Do I cry at schindler's list
Or weep at the passion of the Christ?!

[EVERYONE ELSE]
Both!

[AARON'S FUTURE SON]
Should I shop retail
When there is no sale
Or kvetch that It's all overpriced?!
I'm gonna haunt you like a poltergeist!
My whole identity's sacrificed!

INT. PASTELS RESTAURANT- NIGHT

An insanely expensive restaurant on the Upper East Side.
The decor is a mixture of chi-chi and rustic, with swagged
silk curtains, handwritten menus and pale pink tablecloths
decorated with arrangements of moss, twigs and hideous
exotic flowers. The clientele is young, wealthy and
confident, dressed in the height of late-eighties style:
pouffy Lacroix dresses, slinky Alaïa, Armani power suits.

CLOSE-UP on a WAITER reading out the specials.

WAITER
With goat cheese profiteroles and I also have an arugula
Caesar salad. For entrées tonight I have a swordfish
meatloaf with onion marmalade, a rare-roasted partridge
breast in raspberry coulis with a sorrel timbale...
Huge white porcelain plates descend on very pale pink linen
table cloths. Each of the entrees is a rectangle about four
inches square and look exactly alike.

CLOSE-UP on various diners as we hear fragments of
conversation. ""Is that Charlie Sheen over there?"" ""Excuse
me? I ordered cactus pear sorbet.""

WAITER
And grilled free-range rabbit with herbed French fries. Our
pasta tonight is a squid ravioli in a lemon grass broth...

CLOSE-UP on porcelain plates containing elaborate
perpendicular desserts descending on another table.

PATRICK BATEMAN, TIMOTHY PRICE, CRAIG MCDERMOTT and DAVID
VAN PATTEN are at a table set for four. They are all wearing
expensively cut suits and suspenders and have slicked-back
hair. Van Patten wears horn-rimmed glasses.

The camera moves in on Bateman as his narration begins:

BATEMAN (V.O.)
We're sitting in Pastels, this nouvelle Northern California
place on the Upper East Side.
The Waiter sets down plates containing tiny, elaborately
decorated starters. As he does so we hear Bateman's
description of each of the men at the table.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in
a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences
between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van
Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the
best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a
bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten
keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress.

VAN PATTEN
What are the rules for a sweater vest?

McDERMOTT
What do you mean?

PRICE
Yes. Clarify.

McDERMOTT
Well, is it strictly informal-

BATEMAN
Or can it be worn with a suit?
McDERMOTT
(Smiling)
Exactly

BATEMAN
With discreet pinstripes you should wear a subdued blue or
charcoal gray vest. A plaid suit would cal I for a bolder
vest.

McDERMOTT
But avoid matching the vest's pattern with your socks or
tie. Wearing argyle socks with an argyle vest will look
too studied.

VAN PATTEN
You think so?

PRICE
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.

VAN PATTEN
Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.

Van Patten leaves the table. As he does so, a busboy
discreetly removes their largely untouched plates.

BATEMAN
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?

PRICE
It looks that way, doesn't it?

McDERMOTT
(Staring at retreating waiter)
Did he just take our plates away?

PRICE
He took them away because the portions are so small he
probably thought we were finished. God, I hate this place.
This is a chicks' restaurant. Why aren't we at Dorsia?

McDERMOTT
Because Bateman won't give the maitre d' head.
(He guffaws)

Bateman throws a swizzle stick at him.

McDermott scans the room, settling on a handsome young man
with slicked-back hair and horn-rimmed glasses.

McDERMOTT
Is that Reed Robinson over there?
PRICE
Are you freebasing or what? That's not Robinson.

McDERMOTT
Who is it then?

PRICE
That's Paul Owen.

BATEMAN
That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the
room. Over there.

He points to another handsome young man with slicked-back
hair and horn-rimmed glasses.

McDERMOTT
Who is he with?

PRICE
(Distracted by the waitress's
cleavage as she bends over to
uncork a bottle of wine – the
waitress glares at him)
Some weasel from Kicker Peabody.

Van Patten returns.

VAN PATTEN
They don't have a good bathroom to do coke in.

McDERMOTT
Are you sure that's Paul Owen over there?

PRICE
Yes. McDufus, I am.

McDERMOTT
He's handling the Fisher account.

PRICE
Lucky bastard.

McDERMOTT
Lucky Jew bastard.

BATEMAN
Oh Jesus, McDermott, what does that have to do with
anything?

McDERMOTT
Listen. I've seen the bastard sitting in his office on the
phone with CEOs, spinning a fucking menorah. The
bastard brought a Hanukkah bush into the office last December.

BATEMAN
You spin a dreidel, McDermott, not a menorah.
You spin a dreidel.

McDERMOTT
Oh my God. Bateman, do you want me to fry you up
some fucking potato pancakes? Some latkes?

BATEMAN
No. Just cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks.

McDERMOTT
Oh I forgot. Bateman's dating someone from the
ACLU.

Price leans over and pats Bateman on the back.

PRICE
The voice of reason. The boy next door. And speaking
of reasonable...

He shows McDermott the bill for the meal.

McDERMOTT
Only $470.

VAN PATTEN
(Without irony)
Not bad.

The others murmur agreement. Four platinum Amex cards slap
down on the table.

INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
Bateman is pouring vintage champagne into flutes. Price is
lighting up a cigar.

McDERMOTT
Last week I picked up this Vassar chick-

VAN PATTEN
Oh God, I was there. I don't need to hear this
story again.

McDERMOTT
But I never told you what happened afterwards. So
okay, I pick up this Vassar chick at Tunnel-hot number, big
tits, great legs, this chick was a little hardbody-and so I
buy her a couple of champagne kirs and she's in the city on
spring break and she's practically blowing me in the
Chandelier Room and so I take her back to my place-

BATEMAN
Whoa, wait. May I ask where Pamela is during all
this?

McDERMOTT
Oh fuck you. I want a blowjob, Bate-man. I want a chick
who's gonna let me-

VAN PATTEN
(Putting his hands over his ears)
I don't want to hear this. He's going to say something
disgusting.

McDERMOTT
You prude. Listen, we're not gonna invest in a co-op
together or jet down to Saint Bart's. I just want some
chick whose face I can sit on for thirty, forty minutes.

Price throws a cigar at McDermott, who catches it.

McDERMOTT
Anyway, so we're back at my place and listen to
this. She's had enough champagne by now to get a fucking
rhino tipsy, and get this-

VAN PATTEN
She let you fuck her without a condom?

McDERMOTT
This is a Vassar girl. She's not from Queens. She
would only-are you ready?
(Dramatic pause)
She would only give me a handjob, and get this...she kept
her glove on.

The men sit in shocked, horrified silence.

ALL IN UNISON Never date a Vassar girl.

EXT. TUNNEL NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

The limo pulls up to the sidewalk outside the Tunnel.
McDermott holds the door open for a passing HOMELESS MAN,
who looks confused.

McDERMOTT
I suppose he doesn't want the car. Price, ask
him if he takes American Express.

PRICE
(Offering card)
You take Amex, dude?

The man stumbles away. The club DOORMAN, seeing the limousine,
unhooks the
velvet rope and welcomes them inside.

INT. LADIES ROOM, TUNNEL - NIGHT

Brilliant white light, a bemused elderly female attendant in a
black-and-white maid's uniform trying to give out paper towels.
MUSIC thuds through an open doorway. Trashed-looking girls
stare into mirrors repairing their eye make-up or sit on the
counter chatting to friends. There are almost as many men as
women in the room. Couples stand in line, twitching as they
wait to do coke. As soon as one bathroom door opens, a couple
lurches out rubbing their noses while another couple rushes
past them and slams the door.

PRICE
There's this theory out now that if you can catch the
AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected,
then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular
dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for
Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-

BATEMAN
I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a
virus.

PRICE
Oh, who knows? They don't know that. Prove it.

Price and Bateman finally get a stall and rush in. Price is
sweating.

PRICE
I'm shaking. You open it.

Bateman opens a tiny packet of coke.

PRICE
Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?

BATEMAN
Maybe it's just the light.

PRICE
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram? (He dips
the corner of his Amex card in the packet and takes a snort)
Oh my God...

BATEMAN
What?

PRICE
It's a fucking milligram of Sweet'n Low!

Bateman dips his Amex in the envelope and snorts.

BATEMAN
It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do
enough of it we'll be okay.

PRICE
I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it
on my fucking All-Bran.

The GUY IN STALL next door yells at them in an effeminate
voice:

GUY IN STALL
Could you keep it down, I'm trying to do drugs!

Price pounds his fist against the stall.

PRICE
(screaming)
SHUT UP!

BATEMAN
Calm down. Let's do it anyway

PRICE
I guess you're right...
(Raising his voice)
THAT IS, IF THE FAGGOT IN THE NEXT STALL THINKS IT'S OKAY!

GUY IN STALL
Fuck you!

PRICE
(Trying to climb up against the aluminum divider)
No, FUCK YOU!!
(He collapses, panting against the stall door)
Sorry, dude. Steroids...Okay, let's do it.

BATEMAN
That's the spirit.

They both dig their platinum Amex cards into the envelope
of white powder, shoveling it up their noses, then sticking
their fingers in to catch the residue and rubbing it into
their gums.

INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Bateman saunters toward the bar as ""Pump Up the Volume""
plays in the background.

BATEMAN (to BARGIRL) Two Stoli on the rocks.

He hands her two drink tickets.

BARGIRL
It's after eleven. Those aren't good anymore. It's
a cash bar. That'll be twenty-five dollars.

Bateman pulls out an expensive-looking wallet and hands her
a $50.

She turns her back and searches the cash register for
change.

BATEMAN You are a fucking ugly bitch I want to stab to
death and then play around with your blood.

The music muffles his voice. She turns around. He is
smiling at her. She gives him his change impassively.

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT- MORNING

Tableaux of Bateman's apartment in the early morning light.
A huge white living room with floor-to-ceiling windows
looking out over Manhattan, decorated in expensive, minimalist
high style: bleached oak floors, a huge white sofa, a large
Baselitz painting (hung upside down) and much expensive
electronic equipment. The room is impeccably neat, and oddly
impersonal - as if it had sprung straight from the pages of
a design magazine.

BATEMAN (V.0.)
My name is Patrick Bateman. I am
twenty-six years old. I live in the American Garden
Buildings on West Eighty-First Street, on the eleventh
floor Tom Cruise lives in the penthouse.

Bateman walks into his bathroom, urinates while trying to
see his reflection in a poster for Les Miserables above his
toilet.

BATEMAN
(V.0.) I believe in taking care of myself, in a
balanced diet, in a rigorous exercise routine. In the
morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an ice
pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand
now.

Bateman ties a plastic ice pack around his face.

Bateman does his morning stretching exercises in the living
room wearing the ice pack.

CUT TO:

A mirror-lined bathroom. Bateman is luxuriating in the
shower steam, scrubbing his body, admiring his muscles.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
After I remove the icepack, I use a deep
pore-cleanser lotion. In the shower, I use a
water-activated gel cleanser, then a honey-almond body
scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub.

Bateman stands in front of a massive marble sink applying a
gel facial masque.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
Then I apply an herb mint facial masque which
I leave on for ten minutes while I prepare the rest of my
routine.

Bateman opens the door of a mirrored cabinet, which is
stocked with immaculate rows of skin care products. He
begins selecting bottles jars and brushes, laying them in
readiness on the marble counter.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
I always use an after-shave lotion with little
or no alcohol because alcohol dries your face out and makes
you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye
balm, followed by a final moisturizing ""protective"" lotion...

Bateman stares into the mirror. The masque has dried,
giving his face a strange distorted look as if it has been
wrapped in plastic. He begins slowly peeling the gel masque
off his face.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some
kind of abstraction, hut there is no real me, only an
entity, something illusory, and though I can hide my cold
gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping you
and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably
comparable: I simply am not there.

INT. BATEMAN BEDROOM - MORNING

Another huge white room, equally minimal: a futon, rumpled
white sheets, a bedside lamp with a halogen bulb, and a large
expensive painting (Eric Fischl or David Salle) chosen by
Bateman's interior decorator.

Dressed in silk boxer shorts, Bateman stands in front of a
huge walk-in closet, filled with rows of expensive shirts,
shoes and designer suits, organized according to color and
tone.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
It is hard for me to make sense on any given
level. My self is fabricated, an aberration. My personality
is sketchy and unformed, my heartlessness goes deep and is
persistent.

Fully dressed in Armani, Bateman stands in front of a
full-length mirror in the middle of his vast bedroom,
adjusting his cuff-links.

BATEMAN (V.0.)
My conscience, my pity, my hopes disappeared
a long time ago, if they ever did exist.

He gives a last look at the mirror and likes what he sees.
He gives his reflection a smile.

INT. OFFICES OF PIERCE & PIERCE - DAY

As Bateman walks down the corridor, he passes another MAN who
looks just like him.

MAN
Morning, Hamilton. Nice tan.

Bateman walks past the desk of JEAN, his secretary, pulling
his Walkman from around his neck. Jean is attractive,
wholesome, earnest. She smiles shyly. She loves him.

JEAN
Late?

BATEMAN
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?

JEAN
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what
he was canceling or why.

BATEMAN
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club.
Anyone else?

JEAN
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.

BATEMAN
When?

JEAN
After six.

BATEMAN
Negative. Cancel it.

Jean follows him into his office.

JEAN
Oh? And what should I say?

BATEMAN
Just...say...no.

JEAN
Just say no?

Jean stands at his desk, waiting for instructions.

BATEMAN
Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols
at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All
right?

JEAN
(Playfully)
Yes, sir.

She turns to leave.

BATEMAN
Oh wait. And I need reservations for two at Arcadia at eight
tonight.

Jean turns around.

JEAN
Oh, something. . romantic?

BATEMAN
No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.

JEAN
I'll do it.

BATEMAN
No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?

JEAN
You look nice today.

Jean exits. Bateman straightens some magazines in his
office, lifts a painting off the wall and puts it back at a
slightly different angle. He fiddles with some pencils in a
beer stein. He puts on some MUSIC and flips through a
Sports Illustrated. He buzzes Jean. She comes in a moment
later with the Perrier and a file.

JEAN
Yes?

BATEMAN
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that
outfit again.

JEAN
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.

BATEMAN
I said ""Do not wear that outfit again."" Wear a
dress. A skirt or something.

Jean stands there, then looks down at herself.

JEAN
(Smiling bravely)
You don't like this, I take it?

BATEMAN
Come on, you're prettier than that.

JEAN
(Sarcastically)
Thanks, Patrick.

The phone RINGS and Jean turns to leave.

BATEMAN
I'm not here. And high heels. I like high heels.

As Jean leaves, Bateman clicks on the TV set in one corner
of the room and starts watching Jeopardy!

INT. TAXI - EVENING

EVELYN WILLIAMS, Patrick Bateman's
fiancée, is making notes with a gold Cross pen and sipping
a bottle of mineral water. Evelyn is blonde, classically
beautiful, expensively educated, and utterly pleased with
herself. She usually addresses Patrick as if he were a
small child.

EVELYN
I'd want a zydeco band, Patrick. That's what I'd
want, a zydeco band. Or mariachi. Or reggae. Something
ethnic to shock Daddy Oh, I can't decide...And lots
of chocolate truffles. Godiva. And oysters on the halfshell.

CLOSE-UP on Bateman, who is wearing a Walkman and staring
out the window.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
I'm trying to listen to the new George
Michael tape but Evelyn-my supposed fiancée-keeps buzzing
in my ear.

Evelyn continues to make notes.

EVELYN
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses.
Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz.
And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.

BATEMAN
(Removing his Walkman)
Do...what.

EVELYN
Get married. Have a wedding.

BATEMAN
Evelyn?

EVELYN
Yes, darling?

BATEMAN
Is your Evian spiked?

EVELYN
We should do it.

BATEMAN
No-I can't take the time off work.

EVELYN
Your father practically owns the company. You can do
anything you like, silly.

BATEMAN
I don't want to talk about it.

EVELYN
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just
quit? You don't have to work.

BATEMAN
Because I...want...to...fit...in.

The taxi bumps to a halt.

INT. ESPACE RESTAURANT- NIGHT

A cavernous garage, harshly spot-lit, decorated in
self-conscious brutalist chic. Iron girders, walls of waxed
plaster featuring exposed rusted pipes, a huge Schnabel
smashed-plate painting on one wall. The tables and chairs are
made of extremely uncomfortable
bolted steel.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
I'm on the verge of tears by the time we arrive at Espace
since I'm positive we won't have a decent table, but we do,
and relief washes over me in an awesome wave.

Tm Price and two downtown types, STASH and VANDEN, are
already seated. Vanden is about twenty, pretty and sullen,
with green streaks in her black hair. Stash is pale, with
ragged black hair and bad skin.

They are all trying to read large stainless steel menus
that look like minimalist art.

PRICE
The menu's in braille.

He gets up to greet them, giving Evelyn a suspiciously long
kiss.

PRICE
I have to talk to you.

He drags her away, half giggling and protesting.

EVELYN
(Over her shoulder)
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden
and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.

BATEMAN
(After smiling at his own reflection in the mirror and
checking his hair)
Hi. Pat Bateman.

Vanden takes his hand reluctantly, says nothing.

BATEMAN
Let me guess-you live in the East Village?

Pause.

STASH
SoHo.

COURTNEY RAWLINSON and LUIS CARRUTHERS arrive at the table.
Courtney is blonde, classically beautiful and from
precisely the same social background as Evelyn, but she is
considerably more fragile and neurotic. Luis is
half-English, half-Argentinean, slightly overweight (a
rarity in this crowd), puppyish and eager to please. He
wears the same type of designer clothes as Price and
Bateman, but with foppish tendencies: velvet jackets,
bow-ties, boldly patterned vests.

They exchange air kisses. As soon as Luis turns his back,
Bateman sneaks a kiss on Courtney's neck.

COURTNEY
(Whispering)
Stop it!

Stash and Vanden watch them in silence.

LATER:

Price is whispering in Evelyn's ear. Everyone else is
quietly eating, except Bateman, who is drinking and watching
Evelyn and Price.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
I am fairly sure that Timothy and Evelyn
are having an affair. Timothy is the only interesting
person I know. Courtney is almost perfect looking. She s
usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs. Tonight
I believe it's Xanax. More disturbing than her drug use,
though, is the fact that she's engaged to Luis Carruthers,
the biggest dufus in the business.

Courtney rouses herself from her drug haze.

COURTNEY
Tell me. Stash...do you think SoHo is
becoming to...commercial?

CARRUTHERS
Yes, I read that.

PRICE
Oh, who gives a rat's ass?

VANDEN
Hey. That affects us.

PRICE
(Wired on coke)
Oh ho ho. That affects us? What
about the massacres in Sri Lanka, honey? Doesn't that
affect us, too? I mean don't you know anything about Sri
Lanka? About how the Sikhs are killing like tons of
Israelis there? Doesn't that affect us?

BATEMAN
Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important
problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign
policy is important, but there are more pressing problems
at hand.

PRICE
Like what?

BATEMAN
Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow
down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world
hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We
have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We
have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and
oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while
also promoting equal rights for women but change the
abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still
somehow maintain women's freedom of choice.

The table stares at Bateman uncomfortably.

BATEMAN
We also have to control the influx of illegal
immigrants. We have to encourage a return to traditional
moral values and curb graphic sex and violence on TV, in
movies, in pop music, everywhere. Most importantly we have
to promote general social concern and less materialism in
young people.

Price chokes on his drink. Everyone is silent and
mystified.

CARRUTHERS
Patrick, how thought-provoking.

INT. EVELYN'S BEDROOM - LATER THE SAME EVENING

Bateman and Evelyn are lying on her bed watching television.

BATEMAN
Why don t you just go for Price?

EVELYN
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?

BATEMAN
He's rich.

EVELYN
Everybody's rich.

BATEMAN
He's good-looking.

EVELYN
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.

BATEMAN
He has a great body

EVELYN
Everybody has a great body now.

Bateman unbuttons his shirt and makes advances to get
Evelyn to have sex with him. She ignores him, watching the
Home Shopping Channel with the remote in her hand. Finally,
he straddles her, penis close to her face. She tries to
look around him at the TV, then takes notice.

EVELYN
What do you want to do with that, floss with it?

Bateman flops back down beside her and stares at the television.

EVELYN
Are you using minoxidil?

BATEMAN
No. I'm not. Why should I ?

EVELYN
Your hairline looks like it's receding.

BATEMAN
It's not.

EXT. STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT

It is 3 a.m. Bateman is standing at an ATM, listening to the
comforting sound of fresh bills thudding out of the machine.
Bateman turns around and watches a solitary young woman walk
past him. He collects his money, placing it carefully in his
wallet, and then walks toward her, whistling. He catches up
to her as she pauses at a red light.

BATEMAN
Hello.

The woman looks suspicious for a moment and then, seeing
his smile, smiles back.

INT. DRY CLEANERS - DAY

Bateman, dressed in an Armani suit
with an unlit cigar between his teeth is standing in a dry
cleaners, arguing with the Chinese woman behind the
counter.

BATEMAN
Listen, wait. You're not...shhh wait...
you're not giving me valid reasons.

The woman continues to speak to him in another language,
grabbing at the sleeve of the jacket.

BATEMAN
What are you trying to say to me?

Her husband has taken Bateman's horribly bloodstained
sheets out of the bag and is staring at them.

BATEMAN
Bleach-ee? Are you trying to say bleach-ee?
Bleach-ee. Oh my God.

She keeps pointing to the jacket and talking.

BATEMAN
(Talking over her)
Two things. One. You can't bleach a Soprani. Out of the question.
Two.
(Louder)
Two. I can only get these sheets in Santa Fe. These are very
expensive sheets and I really need them clean.

She keeps talking and Bateman leans into her.

BATEMAN
If you don't shut your fucking mouth I will kill
you, are you understanding me?

She talks faster.

BATEMAN
Now listen-I have a very important lunch meeting
(Checks Rolex)
at Hubert's in thirty minutes, and I need those
...no wait, twenty minutes. I have a lunch meeting at
Hubert's in twenty minutes with Ronald Harrison and I need
those sheets cleaned by this afternoon.

She keeps talking.

BATEMAN Listen. I cannot understand you.

Bateman starts laughing, slaps his hand down on the
counter.

BATEMAN
This is crazy. You're a fool. I can't cope with
this.

Bateman is on the verge of tears.

BATEMAN
Stupid bitchee! Understand? Oh Christ!

Someone enters the store behind him. It's VICTORIA,
late-twenties, attractive but a little overweight, wearing a
tailored business suit with white sneakers and sports socks.

VICTORIA
Patrick?

She takes off her sunglasses.

VICTORIA
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.

BATEMAN
Hello
(Mumbles un incomprehensible name)

Awkward pause.

BATEMAN
Well.

VICTORIA
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here,
but you
know. They really are the best.

BATEMAN
Then why can't they get these stains out? I mean can you talk
to these people or something? I'm not getting anywhere.

Victoria moves toward the sheet that the old man is holding
up. She
touches it and the woman behind the counter begins talking
again.

VICTORIA
Oh my, I see. What are those? Oh my.
BATEMAN
Um, well...it s cranberry juice. Cranapple.

VICTORiA
(Skeptically) Really?

BATEMAN
Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You
know, like...
like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?

VICTORIA
(As if sharing a secret joke) Oh yeah. Oh I get it.
Fun with chocolate.

BATEMAN
Listen, if you could talk to them
(He yanks the sheet out of the man's hand)
I would really appreciate it. I'm really late. I have a
lunch appointment at Hubert's in fifteen minutes.

Bateman turns to leave.

VICTORIA
Hubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right?

BATEMAN
Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank
you, uh...
Victoria?

VICTORIA
Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You
know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.

BATEMAN
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the
time.

VICTORIA
Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?

BATEMAN
(Checking his watch)
Next Saturday?

VICTORIA
(Shrugging)
Yeah.

BATEMAN
Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matinée of Les Miserables.
Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call
you.

VICTORIA
Okay. Do.

Bateman glares at the woman behind the counter and rushes
out the door. Victoria stares after him as we hear the sound
of the bell on the closing door.

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - DAY

Bateman is sitting on the sofa watching a video, talking to
Courtney on a portable phone. He's holding a video box in one
hand, perusing the title: Inside Lydia's Ass. Offscreen we hear
the sounds of the porn movie as he talks.

BATEMAN
Listen, what are you doing tonight?

COURTNEY
What? Oh, I'm...busy.

BATEMAN
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me,
and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to
tonight?

COURTNEY
Stop it. I'm...

BATEMAN
On a lot of lithium?

COURTNEY
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call
tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.

BATEMAN
You should come have dinner with me.
COURTNEY
But-when?

BATEMAN
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?

COURTNEY
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I
need to be
home for that.

BATEMAN
Pumpkin?

COURTNEY
Yes?

BATEMAN
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.

COURTNEY
Uh huh.

BATEMAN
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New
York.

COURTNEY
I know. Stop it.

BATEMAN
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling
dickweed.

COURTNEY
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.

BATEMAN
Courtney? Dinner?

COURTNEY
I can't.

BATEMAN
I'm thinking Dorsia.

COURTNEY
Dorsia's nice.

BATEMAN
Nice?

COURTNEY
You like it there, don't you?

BATEMAN
The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will
you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a
boyfriend to eat there tonight.

COURTNEY
Okay. Yeah. What time?

BATEMAN
Eight?

COURTNEY
Pick me up?

BATEMAN
Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear
something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?

Bateman hangs up, opens up the Zagat's guide and dials the
number for Dorsia with trembling fingers. It's busy and so
he puts it on speakerphone, constant redial. He waits with
his head in his hands, sweating with anxiety, until there
is finally an answer.

MAITRE D'
Dorsia. Please hold.

He is on hold for a long time, getting very tense.

MAITRE D'
Dorsia.

BATEMAN
(Both of his eyes are closed)
Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to
reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?

Long pause. The Maitre D' starts giggling quietly and then
more loudly until the laughter is almost hysterical and he
hangs up the phone.

INT. TAXI- NIGHT

Bateman and Courtney are in the back of a cab. Courtney is
heavily medicated.

COURTNEY
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really
relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this
silver muffin dish.
(She starts to pass out)

BATEMAN
Is that Donald Trump's car?

COURTNEY
(Thickly)
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.

BATEMAN
You know, Courtney, you should take some more
lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you
out of this slump.

COURTNEY
I just want to have a child. Just...two...
perfect...children...
(Her voice trails as she descends back into a drug haze)

The cab draws up outside a restaurant. The awning reads
""Barcadia.""

INT. BARCADIA - NIGHT

An insanely expensive nouvelle Italian restaurant all
polished natural brick, spotless white tablecloths,
minimalist flower arrangements, discreet lighting.

A waiter has come to take their drink orders.

BATEMAN
J&B. Straight.

COURTNEY
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with
a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman
leans over and pulls her back up.

COURTNEY
Are we here?

BATEMAN
Yes.

COURTNEY
This is Dorsia?

BATEMAN
(Examining a menu that says ""Barcadia"" in large script)
Yes, dear.

Courtney almost falls asleep while looking at her menu, and
starts to slide off of her chair. Bateman grabs her by both
shoulders and props her up.

BATEMAN
Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter
soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine
called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish."" You'll
love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and
pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely.

COURTNEY
Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.

She falls asleep at the table.

INT. COURTNEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Bateman and Courtney are in Courtney's bed. Bateman is on
top of her, reaching for a condom in the ashtray. He tears
it open with his teeth, puts it on.

COURTNEY
(Dazed on lithium)
I want you to fuck me.

Bateman gets on top of her, starts to fuck her.

COURTNEY
Luis is a despicable twit.

BATEMAN
Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.

He keeps fucking her.

COURTNEY
No, you idiot. I said ""Is it a receptacle tip?""
Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip?
Get off me.

BATEMAN
Is it a what?

COURTNEY
Pull out.

BATEMAN
I'm ignoring you.

COURTNEY
(screaming)
Pull out, goddamnit!

BATEMAN
(Slowing down but not stopping)
What do you want, Courtney?

She pushes him away from her.

BATEMAN
It's a plain end. I think.

COURTNEY
Turn the light on.

She tries to sit up.

BATEMAN
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.

COURTNEY
Patrick. Turn on the Light.
He turns on the light.

BATEMAN
It's a plain end, see? So?

COURTNEY
Take it off.

BATEMAN
Why?

COURTNEY
Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip –
(She covers herself with her comforter)
to catch the force of the ejaculate!
BATEMAN
I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?

Courtney throws a pillow over her head and starts crying.

COURTNEY
(Screaming)
Do you think you're turning me on by having unsafe sex?

Bateman pulls the pillow off her and slaps her face.

BATEMAN
Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see,
Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.
(He slaps her again lightly)
Why is it pulled down half an inch?
So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!

COURTNEY
(Choking crying)
Well, it's not a turn-on for me.
I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.

Bateman grabs her head and makes her look at the condom.

BATEMAN
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?

COURTNEY
Oh God, just get it over with.

He fucks her quickly until he has a mediocre orgasm and
falls down next to her. They lie side by side with their
bodies not touching, eyes open, staring at the
ceiling.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, PIERCE & PIERCE - DAY

Bateman and Luis Carruthers are seated at a long table in
the conference room at Pierce & Pierce, which looks out onto
a spectacular view of Manhattan.

CARRUTHERS
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney.
Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a
reservation there?

BATEMAN
Lucky, I guess.

CARRUTHERS
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess,
Valentino Couture?

BATEMAN
Uh huh.

CARRUTHERS
(Reaching out to touch it)
It looks so soft.

BATEMAN
(Catching Luis hand)
Your compliment was sufficient Luis.

Carruthers is distracted by a question from the colleague
on his left.Paul Owen enters, carrying the Wall St. Journal
under his arm. He is handsome, supremely confident and
self-satisfied; he sees himself as a leader among men.

OWEN
(To Bateman)
Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?

BATEMAN
I've been great. And you?

Their conversation fades down as we hear Bateman's
thoughts.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
Owen has mistaken me for this dickhead Marcus Halberstam.
It seems logical because Marcus also works at P&P and in
fact does the same exact thing I do and he also has a
penchant for Valentino suits and Oliver Peoples glasses.
Marcus and I even go to the same barber, although I have
a slightly better haircut.

During this voiceover the CAMERA WANDERS over to MARCUS
HALBERSTAM, who is conferring with a colleague in the
opposite corner of the room. He bears a
superficial resemblance to Bateman.

OWEN
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?

BATEMAN
(Nervous)
It's...it's...all right.

OWEN
Really? That's interesting.
(He stares at Bateman, smiling)
Not great?

BATEMAN
Oh well, you know.

OWEN
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.

BATEMAN
Oh yes. I'm very lucky.

McDermott and Price enter.

McDERMOTT
Hey. Owen! Congratulations on the Fisher account.

OWEN
Thank you, Baxter.

PRICE
Listen, Paul. Squash?

OWEN
Call me.
(Hands him a business card)

PRICE
How about Friday?

OWEN
No can do. Got a res at eight-thirty at Dorsia. Great sea
urchin ceviche. There is a stunned silence as he walks away
and sits in a corner of the room, ostentatiously studying papers.

CLOSE-UP on Bateman's face, cold with hatred.

PRICE
(Whispering)
Jesus. Dorsia? On a Friday night? How'd he swing that?

McDERMOTT (Whispering)
I think he's lying.

Bateman takes out his wallet and pulls out a card.

PRICE
(Suddenly enthused)
What's that, a gram?

BATEMAN
New card. What do you think?

McDermott lifts it up and examines the lettering carefully.

McDERMOTT
Whoa. Very nice. Take a look.

He hands it to Van Patten.

BATEMAN
Picked them up from the printers yesterday

VAN PATTEN
Good coloring.

BATEMAN
That's bone. And the lettering is something called
Silian Rail.

McDERMOTT
(Envious)
Silian Rail?

VAN PATTEN
It is very cool, Bateman. But that's nothing.

He pulls a card out of his wallet and slaps it on the
table.

VAN PATTEN
Look at this.

They all lean forward to inspect it.

PRICE
That's really nice.

Bateman clenches his fists beneath the table, trying to
control his anxiety.

VAN PATTEN
Eggshell with Romalian type.
(Turning to Bateman)
What do you think?

BATEMAN
(Barely able to breath, his voice a croak)
Nice.

PRICE
(Holding the card up to the light)
Jesus. This is really super. How'd a nitwit like you get so
tasteful?

Bateman stares at his own card and then enviously at
McDermott's.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.

PRICE
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.

He holds up his own card.

PRICE
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...

BATEMAN
(Choking with anxiety)
Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.

Price pulls a card from an inside coat pocket and holds it
up for their inspection: ""PAUL OWEN, PIERCE & PIERCE,
MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS."" Bateman swallows, speechless.
The sound in the room dies down and all we hear is a faint
heartbeat as Bateman stares at the magnificent card.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
Look at that subtle off-white coloring. The tasteful thickness
of it. Oh my God, it even has a watermark...

His hand shaking, Bateman lifts up the card and stares at it
until it fills the screen.

He lets it fall. The SOUND RETURNS TO NORMAL.

CARRUTHERS Is something wrong? Patrick...you're sweating.

EXT. STREET- EVENING

The financial district. The streets are eerily deserted.

Bateman stands at an ATM, enjoying the reassuring sound of
$500 in fresh bills thudding from the machine. As he turns
to leave, he notices someone across the street.

A HOMELESS MAN is lying in a doorway on top of an open
grate, surrounded by bags of garbage and a shopping cart. A
cardboard sign is attached to the front of the cart: I AM
HOMELESS AND HUNGRY PLEASE HELP ME. A small, thin dog lies
next to him.

He is black, dressed in a stained, torn, lime-green
polyester pants suit with jeans worn over the pants.

BATEMAN
(Offering his hand) Hello. Pat Bateman.

The Homeless Man stares at Bateman, struggling to sit up.

BATEMAN
You want some money?. Some...food?

The Homeless Man nods and starts to cry. Bateman reaches
into his pocket and pulls out a $I 0 bill, then changes his
mind and holds out a $5 instead.

BATEMAN
Is this what you need?

The Homeless Man nods, looks away, wipes his nose.

HOMELESS MAN
I'm so hungry.

BATEMAN
It's cold out, too, isn't it?

HOMELESS MAN
I'm so hungry.

BATEMAN
(Holding the bill just out of the man's reach)
Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you
get a job?

HOMELESS MAN
(Shivering and sobbing)
I lost my job...

BATEMAN
Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it?
Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on
the job?

HOMELESS MAN I was fired. I was laid off.

BATEMAN
Gee, uh, that's too bad.

HOMELESS MAN
I'm so hungry.

The dog starts to whimper.

BATEMAN
Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?

HOMELESS MAN
I'm not...

BATEMAN
You're not what? Qualified for anything else?

HOMELESS MAN
I'm hungry

BATEMAN
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record.
I'm trying to help you.

HOMELESS MAN
I'm hungry.

BATEMAN
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who
do have jobs? From people who do work?

HOMELESS MAN
What am I gonna do?

BATEMAN
Listen, what's your name?

HOMELESS MAN
Al.

BATEMAN
Speak up. Come on.

HOMELESS MAN
Al.

BATEMAN
Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude.
That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together.
I'll help you.

HOMELESS MAN
You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind
man. I can tell.

BATEMAN
(Petting the dog)
Shhhh...it's okay.

HOMELESS MAN
(Grabbing Bateman's wrist)
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.

BATEMAN
(Stroking his face, whispering)
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.

HOMELESS MAN
I can't...I can't find a shelter

BATEMAN
You reek. You reek of...shit. Do you know that?
(Shouting)
Goddammit, Al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of
faggot. Al...I'm sorry.

Bateman carefully puts the money back in his wallet.

BATEMAN
It's just that...I don't know I don't have anything in common
with you.

He opens his briefcase and pulls out a long thin knife with
a serrated edge. He pushes up the sleeve of his jacket to
protect it.

BATEMAN
Do you know what a fucking loser ,you are?

HOMELESS MAN'S POV as Bateman lunges at him with the knife.

EXTREME WIDE SHOT of the street. Bateman's shadowed figure
is hunched over the Homeless Man, stabbing him in the stomach.
The dog barks wildly and Bateman stomps on it until it is
silent.

LOW ANGLE shot of Bateman as he throws a quarter on the ground.

BATEMAN
There's a quarter. Go buy some gum.

Bateman walks calmly into the empty caverns of Wall Street.
Cars drift past, their headlights momentarily illuminating the
body left twitching on the ground.

INT. BEAUTY SALON - DAY

CLOSE-UP on Bateman's face and torso. His eyes are closed as a
woman's hands rub cream into his face.

FACIALIST
What beautiful skin you have, Mr Bateman. So
fine, so smooth...

His eyes open to look up at the facialist and then he
closes them again.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
I have all the characteristics of a human being- flesh, blood,
skin, hair-but not a single clear, identifiable emotion except
for greed ,und disgust. Something horrible is happening inside
me and I don't know why.

CUT TO:

Bateman sitting in a chair, looking down at the
MANICURIST who is giving him a pedicure. She is cutting his
nails with tiny sharp scissors. He stares at them longingly.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
My nightly bloodlust has overflowed into my days. I feel lethal,
on the verge of frenzy.

CUT TO:

Bateman lying irradiated by ultraviolet light on a tanning
bed, wearing goggles.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.

INT. TEXARKANA RESTAURANT - NIGHT

An insanely expensive nouvelle Tex-Mex restaurant, with an
ironic Southwestern decor: Santa Fe colors, Navajo blankets,
naive cowboy art, rawhide banquettes.

Bateman bursts in the door, late, and approaches the MAITRE D'.

BATEMAN
Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?

MAITRE D'
Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.

Paul Owen is seated at a table underneath an enormous pair of
ram's horns. He is arguing with the WAITER.

OWEN
No, I want to know. I came here for the cilantro
crawfish gumbo, which is after all the only excuse one
could have for being in this restaurant, which is by the
way, almost completely empty. Am I to believe that all ten
people in this restaurant have eaten your entire supply of
cilantro crawfish gumbo?

WAITER
I'm very sorry sir. There was a fire in the kitchen
earlier today, and-

BATEMAN
J&B, straight. And a Dixie beer.

WAITER
Would you like to hear-

OWEN
Double Absolut martini.

WAITER
Yes, sir. Would you like to hear the specials?

BATEMAN
Not if you want to keep your spleen.

The Waiter leaves.

OWEN
This is a real beehive of, uh, activity, Halberstam.

This place is hot, very hot.

BATEMAN
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous
here.

OWEN
Yeah, well, you're late.

BATEMAN
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break
(Studying the menu; he's in a surprisingly good mood)
Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.

OWEN
We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.

BATEMAN
Nobody goes there anymore.

There is a long disgruntled silence.

BATEMAN
Is that Ivana Trump over there? (Laughs) Jeez
Patrick I mean Marcus, what are you thinking? Why would Ivana
be at Texarkana?

Another pause.

BATEMAN
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the
Fisher account? How did you get it?

OWEN
I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have
to kill you.

He guffaws. Bateman laughs politely.

LATER:
Paul Owen is very drunk. BATEMAN cold sober.

BATEMAN
I like to dissect girls. Did you know I'm utterly insane?

Owen continues laughing and motions to the waiter for another
drink.

OWEN
Great tan, Marcus. Really impressive. Where do you tan?

BATEMAN Salon.

OWEN
I've got a tanning bed at home. You should look into it.

Bateman nods, agitated.

OWEN
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?

BATEMAN
Cecelia is, well...you know (Cecelia. I think
she's having dinner with...Evelyn Williams.

OWEN
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick
Bateman. What a dork.

BATEMAN
Another Martini, Paul?

Owen nods drunkenly.

LATER:

The end of the meal. Owen is squeezing a lime onto the
table, missing his beer, incredibly drunk. The check is laid
down.

BATEMAN
(Talking to Owen like a child)
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy.
Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.

BATEMAN
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave
a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?

OWEN
No, man. I'm gonna bail.

BATEMAN
Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.
(Helping him into his jacket)
I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a
bottle of Absolut waiting for us.

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
The living room floor has been meticulously covered with
newspaper.

Owen is slumped drunkenly in a white Eames chair, a glass
in his hand. Bateman is looking through his CDs.

BATEMAN
You like Huey Lewis and the News?

OWEN
They're okay.
BATEMAN
Their early work was a little too New Wave for my
taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really
came into their own, commercially and artistically.

Bateman walks to his bathroom, taking a large ax out of the
shower. He takes two Valium.

BATEMAN
(Said partly from the bathroom)
The whole album has a clear, crisp sound and a new sheen of
consummate professionalism that gives the songs a big boost.
Bateman comes back out and leans the ax against the wall.
He walks to the foyer and puts on a raincoat, watching Owen
from behind ail the time.

BATEMAN
He's been compared to ELvis Costello but I think
Huey has a more bitter, cynical sense of humor.

Owen is absent-mindedly leafing through the Barneys
catalogue.

OWEN
Hey, Halberstam?

BATEMAN
Yes, Owen?

OWEN
Why are there copies of the Style section all over
the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?

BATEMAN
No, Owen.

OWEN
(Confused)
Is that a raincoat?

BATEMAN
Yes, it is.

Bateman moves to the CD player. He takes a CD out of its
case and slides it in the machine.

BATEMAN
In 1987 Huey released this, Fore!, their most
accomplished album. I think I heir undisputed masterpiece is
""HiP To Be Square,"" a song so catchy that most people probably
don't listen to the lyrics. But they should because it's not
just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of
trends. It's al~ a personal statement about the band itself.

Bateman puts on ""Hip To Be Square.""

BATEMAN crosses the room and picks up the ax.

We follow BATEMAN from behind as he walks up to Owen, the
ax raised over his head.

BATEMAN
Hey, Paul?

As Owen turns around, FROM OWEN'S POV we see Bateman swing
the ax toward his face.

Blood sprays onto the white raincoat.

FROM BEHIND OWEN, we see BATEMAN as he yanks the ax out.

Owen drops to the floor. His body falls out of the frame.
We stay on his legs twitching mechanically.

Blood pulses onto the newspaper-covered floor.

BATEMAN
(Raising the ax and screaming)
Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now, you fucking
stupid bastard!

LOW ANGLE ON BATEMAN as he beats Owen with the back of the
ax.

OFFSCREEN, the sound of the ax hitting Owen.

BATEMAN
(Panting)
Fucking bastard...

Bateman takes his raincoat off, still panting. He folds the
coat carefully in half, bloody side in, and drapes it neatly
over the back of a chair.

He sits back on the white sofa and surveys the scene. He
checks his Rolex and lights a cigar.

OFFSCREEN, Paul Owen's last faint sighs are heard.

INT. LOBBY - NIGHT

BATEMAN drags a large, blood-soaked sleeping bag through the lobby,
past the bored doorman, who looks up from the Post for a moment.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

BATEMAN is trying to hail a cab. Owen's body is at his
feet. Luis Carruthers and a Japanese girl walk up to him.

CARRUTHERS
Patrick? Is that you?

BATEMAN
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.

CARRUTHERS
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good
friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to
Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.
(Looking down at the body)
Where did you get your overnight bag?

BATEMAN
Commes des Garcon.

A cab stops. BATEMAN opens the door and manages to get
Owen's body into the backseat.

Bateman gets into the cab.

CARRUTHERS
Call me please, Patrick.

BATEMAN
Jesus lives, Luis.

INT. BATEMAN'S HELL'S KITCHEN APARTMENT - NIGHT

A bare room, lit by one light bulb. The walls are blank
except for a Les Miserables poster. There is one ratty chair.

Bateman pours lime over Paul Owen's body, which is lying in
a bathtub. He plays Huey Lewis, smokes a cigar, watches the
body dissolve.

INT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Bateman is letting himself into the apartment. It is very
similar to Bateman's, but even more minimalist. The walls
are white-pigmented concrete with a large minimalist painting
on the wall. One wall is covered in a trendy, large-scale
scientific drawing above a long, black leather couch.

BATEMAN
Where to send the bastard? Dallas? Pans?

He throws some clothes into a suitcase, randomly grabbing
toiletries and shoving them in.

BATEMAN
Singapore? London. I'll send the asshole to London.

He puts some music on to help muffle his voice, then leans
over the answering machine.

He does a passable imitation of Owen's speech.

BATEMAN
Hi, this is Paul. I've been called away to London
for a few days. Meredith, I'll call you when I get back.
Hasta la vista, baby.

INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - MORNING

Bateman is sitting at his desk, with the latest copy of
Sports Illustrated in front of him and his Walkman playing
Kenny G. We hear the MUSIC until Jean enters and he takes
the Walkman off.

BATEMAN
(Faintly irritable)
What is it?

JEAN
Patrick?

BATEMAN
(Condescendingly)
Ye-es, Je-an?

JEAN
Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.

BATEMAN
Who?

JEAN
Detective Donald KIMBALL?

Silence. Bateman stares out the window, then down at the
drawing of a headless woman he's been doodling on the back
cover of Sports Illustrated.

BATEMAN
Tell him I'm at lunch.

JEAN
(whispering)
Patrick, I think he knows you're here.
It's only ten-thirty.

Silence.

BATEMAN
Send him in, I guess. As she exits, he picks up the cordless
phone and pretends to talk to someone at the other end.

BATEMAN
Now, John, you've got to wear clothes in proportion
to your physique. There are definite do's and don'ts, good
buddy, of wearing a bold-striped shirt. A hold-striped shirt
calls for solid-colored or discreetly patterned suits and ties...

The door to the office opens and he waves in DETECTIVE DONALD
KIMBALL. KIMBALL is surprisingly young - about Bateman's age -
and good-looking, dressed in a crumpled linen Armani suit of
the type Bateman and his friends might wear.

Kimball sits down and crosses his legs with a
self-assurance that makes Bateman so nervous he forgets to
carry on with his fake conversation. Kimball looks up at
him curiously, noticing the silence.

BATEMAN
(Realizing that Kimball is staring at him)
Right. And yes...always tip the stylist fifteen percent.

Bateman shrugs at the detective, rolling his eyes in
exasperation.

KIMBALL nods understandingly.

BATEMAN
Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just
walked in...
(He laughs inanely)
Just joking...
(Pause)
No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John,
right, got it.
(He hangs up the phone and pushes the antenna in)
Sorry about that.

KIMBALL
No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.
(Gesturing toward the phone)
Was that anything important?

BATEMAN
Oh that? Just mulling over business problems.
Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors...
Spreading gossip.

They laugh politely.

KIMBALL
(Holding out his hand)
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL

BATEMAN
(Shaking firmly)
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.

KIMBALL
I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but I was supposed
to talk to Luis Carruthers and he wasn't in and...well,
you're here, so...I know how busy you guys can get.

KIMBALL stares at the three open copies of Sports
Illustrated and the Sony Walkman lying on Bateman's desk.
Bateman sees the look and sweeps the magazines
into the top drawer along with the Walkman, which is
still running.

BATEMAN
(Forcing himself to sound friendly and relaxed)
So, what's the topic of discussion?

KIMBALL
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate
the disappearance of Paul Owen.

BATEMAN
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?

KIMBALL
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.

BATEMAN
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.

KIMBALL
So it's nothing that official. I just have some
basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-

BATEMAN
Coffee?

KIMBALL
No. I'm okay.

BATEMAN
Perrier? San Pellegrino?

KIMBALL
No, I'm okay.

KIMBALL takes out a small black notepad and the same gold
Cross pen that Bateman and his friends all use. Bateman buzzes
Jean.

JEAN (O.S.)
Patrick?

BATEMAN
Can you bring Mr...

KIMBALL
KIMBALL.

BATEMAN
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-

KIMBALL
Oh no, I'm okay.

BATEMAN
It's no problem

Bateman watches intently as KIMBALL writes something down
in his notebook, then crosses something out. Jean enters
and places the bottle of San Pellegrino and a Steuben etched
glass on the table, shooting a concerned glance at Bateman.
He glares at her. KIMBALL smiles and nods at Jean as she leaves.

BATEMAN
Well, what's the topic of discussion?

KIMBALL
The disappearance of Paul Owen.

BATEMAN
Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the
disappearance or anything...
(Trying to laugh)
Not on ""Page Six"" at least.

KIMBALL
I think his family wants this kept quiet.

BATEMAN
Understandable.
(Staring at the untouched bottle of San Pellegrino)
Lime?

KIMBALL
No, really. I'm okay.

BATEMAN
You sure? I can always get you a lime.

A pause.

KIMBALL
Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own
files, okay?

BATEMAN
Shoot.

KIMBALL
How old are you?

BATEMAN
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.

KIMBALL
(Scribbling in his notebook)
Where did you go to school?

BATEMAN
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.

KIMBALL
Your address?

BATEMAN
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American
Gardens Building.

KIMBALL
(Looking up, impressed)
Nice. Very nice.

BATEMAN
(Flattered)
Thanks.

A pause as KIMBALL studies his notebook. Bateman closes his
eyes, as if in pain.

KIMBALL
Pardon me, but are you okay?

BATEMAN
Who do you ask?

KIMBALL
You seem...nervous.

Bateman reaches into his desk drawer and brings out a
bottle of aspirin.

BATEMAN
Nuprin?

KIMBALL Uh...no, thanks.

Kimball takes out a pack of Marlboro's and lays it on the
desk.

BATEMAN
Bad habit.

KIMBALL
I know. I'm sorry.

A pause, as Bateman stares at the cigarettes.

KIMBALL
Would you rather I not smoke?

BATEMAN
No, I guess it's okay.

KIMBALL
You sure?

BATEMAN
No problem.
(Buzzing Jean)

JEAN (O.S.)
Yes, Patrick?

BATEMAN
Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please.
She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.

KIMBALL
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?

BATEMAN
Well...

He coughs, shakes two Nuprin into his hand and swallows
them dry.

KIMBALL
How well did you know him?

BATEMAN
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing,
you know.

KIMBALL
Yale thing?

A pause.

BATEMAN
Yeah...Yale thing.

KIMBALL
What do you mean...Yale thing?

A pause.

BATEMAN
Well, I think for one that he was probably a closet
homosexual. Who did a lot of cocaine...that Yale thing.

A silence during which the sound of the air conditioner
becomes deafening.

KIMBALL
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul
Owen?

BATEMAN
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He...
ate a balanced diet.

KIMBALL
What kind of man was he? Besides...
(He hesitates tries to smile)
the information you've just given.

BATEMAN
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.

KIMBALL
Do you feel that way?

BATEMAN
No. Not really.

KIMBALL
(As he writes without looking up)
Where did Paul hang out?

BATEMAN
Hang...out?

KIMBALL
Yeah. You know...hang out.

BATEMAN
Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine.
Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular
places.

KIMBALL
He had a yacht?

BATEMAN
No, he just hung out there.

KIMBALL
And where did he go to school?

A slight pause.

BATEMAN
Don't you know this?

KIMBALL
I just wanted to know if you know.
BATEMAN
Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's...
Listen, I just...I just want to help.

KIMBALL
I understand.

He makes another note.

KIMBALL
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?

BATEMAN
We were both seven in 1969.

KIMBALL
(Smiles)
So was I.

BATEMAN
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?

KIMBALL
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he
went to London.

BATEMAN
Well, maybe he did, huh?

KIMBALL
His girlfriend doesn't think so.

BATEMAN
But...has anyone seen him in London?

KIMBALL
Actually, yes.

BATEMAN
Hmmm.

KIMBALL
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification.
A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but
I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert
Ainsworth for Paul, so...

BATEMAN
Oh.

KIMBALL
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan
worship?

BATEMAN
What?

KIMBALL
I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I
know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't
know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was
recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano
girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-

BATEMAN
Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced
diet and-

KIMBALL
Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing.

A pause - the longest so far.

BATEMAN
Have you consulted a psychic?

KIMBALL
No.

BATEMAN
Had his apartment been burglarized?

KIMBALL
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A
suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.

BATEMAN
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet
or anything, right?

KIMBALL
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But...
basically no one has seen or heard anything.

BATEMAN
That's so typical, isn't it?

KIMBALL
It's just strange.
(He stares out the window, lost in thought)
One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive,
and then...

BATEMAN
Nothing.

KIMBALL
People just...disappear.

BATEMAN
The earth just opens up and swallows people.
(He checks his Rolex)

KIMBALL
Eerie. Really eerie.

Silence.

BATEMAN
(Standing up)
You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting
with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes.

KIMBALL
Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I
mean aren't you going to be late?

BATEMAN
Uh, no. There's one...down here.

KIMBALL
Oh really? I didn't know that.

Bateman leads him to the door.

BATEMAN
Yes. It's very good.

KIMBALL turns to face him.

KIMBALL
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information
at all...

BATEMAN
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.

KIMBALL
Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman.

Bateman closes the door firmly on KIMBALL. He closes his
eyes and leans against the door, sweating.

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

A perfectly lit kitchen still-life - a bottle of Evian,
a white porcelain plate on which sits a sliced kiwi, some perfect
green grapes, a few berries.

OFFSCREEN, the SOUND OF SCREAMS AND A CHAINSAW can be heard
from the living room.

The living room: Bateman is maniacally doing abdominal
crunches as the television plays a video of Texas Chainsaw
Massacre. There is a pile of horror videos on his coffee table,
next to a copy of GQ.

LATER:

Bateman is sitting in his armchair, phone book in hand,
jerking off. He is squealing into the phone and breathing.

BATEMAN
You like that, slut?

The person on the other end clearly hangs up.

CLOSE-UP on his fingers dialing the phone.

BATEMAN
You want to know what I'm wearing? Sixty-dollar
boxer shorts by Ralph Lauren, a hundred-and-fifty-dollar white
cotton T-shirt by
Commes des Garcons.
(He snorts like a pig)
My Rolex cost-

Another hang-up. He dials again.

BATEMAN
(Whipering)
I'm a corporate raider. I orchestrate hostile takeovers. What do
you think of that?
(Makes disgusting sucking noises and grunts)
Huh, bitch?

GIRL (O.S.)
Dad, is that you?

Bateman hangs up, frustrated.

EXT. STREET/INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

Bateman cruises around in the limo. It pulls up alongside
CHRISTIE, a pretty blonde hooker in shorts and leather jacket.
Bateman opens his window to speak to her.

BATEMAN
I haven't seen you around here.

CHRISTIE
You just haven't been looking.

BATEMAN
Would you like to see my apartment?

Bateman flips on the light inside the limo. He's wearing a
tuxedo.

CHRISTIE
(looking away to some dark corner)
I'm not supposed to.

Bateman is holding out a $100 bill, which Christie now
notices, then takes.

BATEMAN
Do you want to come to my apartment or not?

CHRISTIE
I'm not supposed to.
(She pockets the bill)
But I can make an exception.

BATEMAN
Do you take American Express?

Christie is still looking out behind her.

BATEMAN
Do you take American Express?

Christie looks at him like he's crazy.

BATEMAN
I'm joking. Come on, get in.

As they drive uptown, Bateman dials the cell-phone. He
reads off a credit card number.

BATEMAN
I'd like a girl, early twenties, blonde, who does
couples. Couples. Fifty-five West Eighty-First, the
American Gardens Building. Apartment 7C. And I really
can't stress blonde enough. Blonde.

He hangs up.

BATEMAN I'm Paul. My name is Paul 0wen, have you'got that?
You are Christie. You are to respond only to Christie. Is
that clear?

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Christie is in the bathtub, Bateman is pouring in white
milky bath oil.

BATEMAN
That's a very fine Chardonnay you're drinking.

Long pause, in which Christie is luxuriating in the tub and
Bateman is casually touching her breast.

BATEMAN
I want you to clean your vagina.

Christie reaches for a washcloth.

BATEMAN
No. From behind. Get on your knees.

Christie shrugs.

BATEMAN
I want to watch. You have a very nice body.

The doorman RINGS. Bateman answers.

BATEMAN
Thank you. Send her up. Christie, get out and dry
off, choose a robe-not the Bijan and come and meet me and
our guest in the living room for drinks.

Bateman answers the door.

BATEMAN
You've arrived! How lovely, let me take your coat.
I'm Paul. How good of you to come.

The escort girl looks somewhat bewildered. Bateman takes
her coat and inspects her body and face.

BATEMAN
Not quite blonde, are you? More dirty blonde. I'm
going to call you Sabrina. I'm Paul Owen.

Bateman escorts her into the living room and brings her a
glass of wine. Christie enters, sitting next to Sabrina on the
couch, and Bateman sits across from them. There is a
long silence.

BATEMAN
So, don't you want to know what I do?

The two girls look at each other with uncomfortable smiles.
Christie shrugs.

CHRISTIE
No.

SABRINA
(Smiling)
No, not really.

Bateman is visibly irritated, recrosses his legs.

BATEMAN
Well, I work on Wall Street. At Pierce & Pierce.
(Long pause)
Have you heard of it?

Another long pause. They shake their heads. Christie stands
up and goes over to the CD collection.

CHRISTIE
You have a really nice place here...Paul.
How much did you pay for it?

BATEMAN
Actually, that's none of your business, Christie,
hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.

Bateman leaves to refill his wine glass and Sabrina takes a
pack of cigarettes out of her purse.
Bateman returns, carrying a tray of chocolates.

BATEMAN
No, no smoking. Not in here.

He walks over to Christie.

BATEMAN
Varda truffle?

Christie stares at the plate and shakes her head. Sabrina
takes one.

BATEMAN
I don't want you to get drunk, but that's a very
fine Chardonnay you're not drinking.

Bateman goes over to his CDs and scans his vast collection.
He takes one out and examines it.

BATEMAN
Do you like Phil Collins? I've been a big Genesis
fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before
that I really didn't understand any of their work. It was too
artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins'
presence became more apparent. He puts aside the CD and takes out
another one.

BATEMAN
I think ""Invisible Touch"" is the group's undisputed
masterpiece.

He puts on the song and gestures for them to follow him
into the bedroom.

BATEMAN
It's an epic meditation on intangibility, at the
same time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding
three albums. Christie, take off the robe.

Bateman puts out a lace teddy. He motions to Christie to
put it on.

BATEMAN
Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks,
Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance
of every instrument. Sabrina, remove your dress.

Bateman starts to undress.

BATEMAN
In terms of lyrical craftsmanship and sheer
songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism.
Sabrina, why don't you dance a little?

Sabrina dances awkwardly. Christie sits on the bed.

BATEMAN
Take the lyrics to ""Land of Confusion."" In this
song, Phil Collins addresses the problem of abusive political
authority.

Bateman knots a silk scarf around Christie's neck - rather
menacingly - then helps her into some suede gloves.

BATEMAN
""In Too Deep"" is the most moving pop song of the 1980s about
monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting.
Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything
I've heard in rock.

He turns on the video camera.

BATEMAN
Christie, get down on your knees, so Sabrina can see your
asshole.

Bateman looks through the viewfinder.

BATEMAN
Phill Collins solo efforts seem to be more commercial and
therefore more satisfying in a narrower way, especially
songs like ""In the Air Tonight"" and ""Against
All Odds."" Sabrina, don't just stare at it. Eat it.

He walks over to the sound system in his bedroom and slides in
the CD.

BATEMAN
But I also think that Phill Collins works better
within the confines of the group than as a solo artist-and
I stress the word artist. This is ""Sussudio,"" a great,
great song, a personal favorite.

SEX MONTAGE CUT TO ""Sussudio."" We see this in WIDE SHOT, or
through the LENS OF THE VIDEO CAMERA.

CUT TO:

Bateman asleep in his bed with Christie and Sabrina
on either side of him. Sabrina accidentally touches his
wrist. Bateman's eyes open.

BATEMAN
Don't touch the Rolex.

Bateman gets up from his bed and goes over to his armoire.

He opens the drawer in which are a nail gun, a coat hanger,
a rusty butter knife and a half-smoked cigar. He turns
around to see Christie and Sabrina both starting to get up
and get dressed. He takes the coat hanger.

BATEMAN
We're not through yet...

CUT TO:

Bateman ushering them out the door impatiently. They
are both sobbing, badly bruised and bleeding. Bateman has a
deep scratch on his hand and one on his shoulder. In the
b.g. Phil Collins' ""In the Air Tonight"" is playing.

INT. YALE CLUB – DAY

McDermott, Van Patten and Bateman are
having drinks. Price walks by with a gorgeous girl and
gives them the finger.

BATEMAN
What an asshole.

McDERMOTT
Why is Laurie Kennedy dating Price? He's a
fucking drug addict. No self-control.

VAN PATTEN
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do
you think, Bateman?

BATEMAN
I know her. I knew her.

McDERMOTT
Why do you say it like that? Why does he say it
like that?

VAN PATTEN
Because he dated her.

BATEMAN
How did you guess?

VAN PATTEN
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ,
Bateman.

BATEMAN
Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy
personality.

McDERMOTT
So what? It's all looks. Laurie Kennedy is a
babe. Don't even pretend you were interested for any other
reason.

VAN PATTEN
If they have a good personality, then something
is very wrong.

McDERMOTT
If they have a good personality and they are not
great looking-who fucking cares?

BATEMAN
Well, let's just say hypothetically, okay? What if
they have a good personality?
(He smiles giving up)
I know, I know-

ALL IN UNISON
There are no girls with good personalities!
(They laugh and high-five each other)

VAN PATTEN
A good personality consists of a chick with a
little hardbody who will satisfy all sexual demands without
being too slutty about things and who will essentially keep
her dumb fucking mouth
shut.

McDERMOTT
Listen, the only girls with good personalities who are
smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or even
talented-though God knows what the fuck that means-are ugly
chicks.

VAN PATTEN
Absolutely.

McDERMOTT
And this is because they have to make up for how
fucking unattractive they are.

Pause.

BATEMAN
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?

VAN PATTEN
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?

BATEMAN
No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was
an interesting guy.

McDERMOTT
So what did Ed say?

BATEMAN
He said, ""When I see a pretty girl walking down the
street I think two things. One part of me wants to take her
out and talk to her and be real nice and sweet and treat
her right.""

Pauses, finishes his drink.

McDERMOTT
What does the other part of him think?

BATEMAN
What her head would look like on a stick.

McDermott and Van Patten look at each other and then back
at Bateman. Bateman starts to laugh, and the other two uneasily
join In.

Luis Carruthers walks up to the table.

CARRUTHERS
(Shyly)
Hi, guys. I wanna get your opinion on something.

McDermott rolls his eyes at the rest of the table.

McDERMOTT If it's about the bow-tie you're wearing, you
know how we feel about it. Luis laughs good-naturedly.

CARRUTHERS
Yes, I do. No, it's my business card-I decided to
get a new one too.

He pulls out something incredibly tasteful. Everyone
compliments Luis except Bateman. The SOUND DROPS and all we hear
is the beating of his heart as he stares at the card enviously.
Luis plucks it from his hand and walks away, pleased with
himself.

VAN PATTEN
Listen, what about dinner?

BATEMAN
(Suddenly angry)
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? ""What about
fucking dinner?""

McDERMOTT
Ah, cheer up, Bateman.
(Slaps him on the back, massages his neck)
What's the matter? No shiatsu this morning?

BATEMAN
(Watching Luis going into the men's room)
Keep touching me like that and you'll draw back a stump.

McDERMOTT
Whoa, hold on there, little buddy.

BATEMAN
Excuse me.

He gets up from the table. As Bateman walks away, Van
Patten grabs a waiter.

VAN PATTEN
Is this tap water? I don't drink tap water Bring
me an Evian or something, okay?

INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY

Bateman pulls on his gloves as he
enters the men's room. Carruthers is standing in a stall with his
back to Bateman. The sound of his urinating is heard until Bateman
approaches, then abruptly stops. Slowly, Bateman brings his hands
up over the collar of Carruthers' cashmere jacket, circling his
neck until both thumbs and index fingers meet. All we can hear
is the sound of Bateman's heavy breathing. Slowly he starts to
squeeze. Almost in slow motion, Carruthers turns around.

Carruthers looks down at Bateman's wrists as if lost in
thought. Then he lowers his head and kisses Bateman's
wrist. He looks back at Bateman with a shy, love-struck
expression, then reaches up and tenderly touches the side
of his face.

CARRUTHERS
God, Patrick. Why here?

He strokes Bateman's hair.

CARRUTHERS
I've seen you looking at me. I've noticed your hot body.

Carruthers tries to kiss him on the lips but Bateman backs
away. He drops his hands from Carruthers' neck. Carruthers
immediately takes them and places them back. Bateman drops
them again.

CARRUTHERS
Don't be shy.

Bateman takes a deep breath, closes his eyes and tries to lift
his hands again, but abandons the attempt.

CARRUTHERS
You don't know how long I've wanted it. Ever since that Christmas
party at Arizona 206. You know the one, you were wearing that
red-striped paisley Armani tie.

Bateman looks down and sees that Carruthers' pants are
still unzipped. He moves past him out of the stall and
stands by the sink and pretends to wash his hands until he
realizes he still has his gloves on. Carruthers comes up
behind him.

CARRUTHERS
I want you. I want you...too.

Bateman storms out of the men's room, bumping into a waiter
and several customers and cursing. Noticing the maitre d'
and another waiter conferring and looking at him strangely,
Bateman straightens up and smiles and waves cheerfully at
them. Carruthers walks up behind him.

BATEMAN
(Hissing)
What...is...it?

CARRUTHERS
Where are you going?

BATEMAN
(Stumbling away from him)
I've gotta...I've
gotta...return some videotapes.

CARRUTHERS
Patrick?

BATEMAN
What?
CARRUTHERS
(Silently mouthing the words)
I'll call you.

Bateman storms out of the restaurant.

INT. COURTNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Bateman is lying on top of Courtney in her bed, after sex.
Still panting, he rolls off her, onto his back. He feels
something lumpy underneath him and pulls out a stuffed toy,
a black cat with blue jewel eyes. There is silence.

COURTNEY
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?

BATEMAN
Maybe.

Courtney sighs and reaches for a bottle of pills on her
nightstand, swallowing several. Bateman gets up and begins
to dress, admiring himself in the mirror. Courtney watches
the TV at low volume.

COURTNEY
What are you doing tonight?

BATEMAN
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.

COURTNEY
That's nice.

BATEMAN
You and...Luis?

COURTNEY
(Lighting a cigarette)
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and
Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...

BATEMAN
I never knew you smoked.

COURTNEY
(Smiling sadly)
You never noticed.

Bateman is making final adjustments to his tie.

COURTNEY
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?

BATEMAN
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're
going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.

COURTNEY
(Sarcastically)
Isn't that special?
(A pause)
Patrick?

BATEMAN
Yes, Courtney?

C0URTNEY
If I don't see you before Thanksgiving, have a nice one, okay?

BATEMAN
(Flatly)
You too.

Courtney picks up the black cat and starts petting its
head. Bateman heads down the hallway to the front door.

COURTNEY
Patrick?

BATEMAN
Yes?

COURTNEY
Nothing.

INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

A big eighties nightclub with a mixed crowd: hip-hop
kids, visitors from Jersey, downtown art people, yuppies.

I Bateman makes his way through the crowd to the bar, and
tries to attract the bartender's attention. He is wearing a
suit and his tie is loosened. Kimball approaches him.

KIMBALL
Mr. Bateman?

Bateman gasps and recovers.

BATEMAN
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell?
KIMBALL
Kimball.
(Extending his hand)
Call me Don.

BATEMAN
Don.

KIMBALL
So...you hang out here a lot?

BATEMAN
Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You
know.

Pause.

BATEMAN
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone
in for ""formal questioning?"" (He makes quotation marks
in the air and laughs a not-so-relaxed laugh)

KIMBALL
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?

BATEMAN
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.

KIMBALL
(Looking at his glass)
Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much
more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting,
don't you think?

Bateman is nodding nervously, idiotically.

KIMBALL
Some people just can t help themselves. Another Stoli?

Bateman shakes his head.

KIMBALL
I mean they want to get caught.

BATEMAN
Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need
anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean
Owen was a...complex man.

Bateman wanders away.

He looks back uneasily at KIMBALL, who is watching him from
the bar. A GUY WITH DREADLOCKS walks by.

BATEMAN
(Holding up his hand to high-five) Rasta Man!

The man stares at him.

BATEMAN
I mean-Mon. We be jammin'...

The man walks by, shaking his head.

Bateman wanders into the next room, which is filled with a
more familiar crowd: young men in designer suits, girls in
black designer dresses. Across the room he spots McDermott
and Price sitting with three models, all wearing black
mini-dresses. Price and McDermott are having a whispered
argument.

PRICE
I have to talk to these girls? They're models.

McDERMOTT
Someone has to get the Bolivian marching powder.
You went last time. Stay here.

McDermott waves gaily to the girls and disappears.
Bateman looks at the models. DAISY and CARON are staring
into space, smoking. LIBBY is trying to work out how to
unfold her napkin. Price signals to Bateman for help.

PRICE
(Clapping his hands together)
Let's have a conversation. So...it was hot out today, no?

Silence.

LIBBY
Where did Craig go?

PRICE
Well, Gorbachev is downstairs. McDermott is going to
sign a peace treaty with him between the United States
and Russia. McDermott's the one behind glasnost, you know.

LIBBY
Well...yeah. But he told me he was in mergers and acquisitions.

PRICE
You're not confused, are you?

LIBBY
No, not really.

CARON
Gorbachev's not downstairs.

DAISY
(Smiling)
Are you Iying?

PRICE
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's
at Tunnel.

BATEMAN
(To Daisy)
Ask me a question.

DAISY
So, what do you do?

BATEMAN
What do you think I do?

DAISY
A model? An actor?

BATEMAN
No. Flattering, but no.

DAISY
Well...

BATEMAN
I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.

DAISY (Unfazed)
Do you like it?

BATEMAN
Welt...it depends, why?

DAISY
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and
acquisitions don't really like it.

Silence.

BATEMAN
So, where do you work out?

MUCH LATER IN THE EVENING:

The club is half-empty now. Price is leaning over a
balcony, messed-up on drugs. Bateman comes up behind him
in a menacing way that suggests he might push him over
the railing. Price turns around, wild-eyed, just as Bateman
is reaching for him.

PRICE
(Shouting)
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.

BATEMAN
Leaving what?

PRICE
This.

Bateman is confused, he thinks Price is referring to his
drink.

BATEMAN
Don't, I'll drink it.

PRICE
(Screaming)
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.

BATEMAN
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?

PRICE
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!

BATEMAN
Don't tell me...merchant banking?

PRICE
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm
disappearing.

BATEMAN
(laughing)
Where to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What?

Price looks away.

McDermott and Daisy walk up to them.

McDERMOTT
Hey-don't worry, be happy.

Price lifts his arms up as if greeting the crowd and is
shouting something that can't be heard, then

PRICE
Goodbye! Fuckheads!

He climbs over the railing.

DAISY What is he doing?

BATEMAN
Price! Come back!

Price leaps from the balcony. He disappears for a moment
then resurfaces and runs off into the crowd.

EXT. CLUB - NIGHT
Bateman and Daisy are waiting for a cab.

DAISY
My ex-boyfriend, Fiddler, who was in there, he plays
in this band that just opened for U2-he couldn't understand
what I was doing with a yuppie.

BATEMAN
Oh really?
DAISY
He said...
(She laughs)
He said you gave him bad vibes.

BATEMAN
That's...that's too bad.

DAISY
You think I'm dumb, don't you?

BATEMAN
What?

DAISY
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.

BATEMAN
(insincerely) No. I really don't.

DAISY
That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you.

She takes his hand as they get into a cab.

INT. DAISY'S HALLWAY - LATER THAT NIGHT

Bateman leaves Daisy's apartment carrying a suitcase. He pauses
in the hallway and tucks some long blonde hair back inside the
case.

INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

Bateman sits at his desk wearing Wayfarers doing the New York
Times crossword puzzle at dusk.

Jean knocks gently on the half-open door and walks in with
a folder in her hand. Bateman ignores her.

JEAN
Doin' the crossword?

Bateman nods without looking up.

JEAN
Need help?

BATEMAN doesn't respond. We see that every space on the
puzzle has been filled in with the words MEAT or BONE. Jean
drops the folder on his desk and then walks out.

BATEMAN
Jean?

JEAN
(Re-enters office)
Yes, Patrick?

BATEMAN
Would you like to accompany me to dinner?

He erases one of the M's on the crossword puzzle.

BATEMAN
That is...if you're not doing anything.

JEAN
Oh no. I have no plans.

BATEMAN
(Lowering his Wayfarers)
Well, isn't this a coincidence.

A pause.

BATEMAN
Listen, where should we go?

He leans back and pulls a Zagat's from the desk drawer.

JEAN
Anywhere you want?

BATEMAN
Let's not think about what I want. How about
anywhere you want.

JEAN
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.

BATEMAN
No, come on. Anywhere you want.

JEAN
Oh, I can't.
(Sighs)
I don't know.

BATEMAN
Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want.
Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.

A long pause.

JEAN
What about...Dorsia?

Bateman stops looking through the Zagat's guide and smiles
at her.

BATEMAN
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...

JEAN
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.

BATEMAN
Dorsia is...fine.

He dials the number.

MAITRE D'
Dorsia, yes?

BATEMAN
Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at
nine o'clock?

He checks his Rolex and winks at Jean.

MAITRE D'
We are totally booked.

BATEMAN
Oh really? That's great.

MAITRE D'
I said we are totally booked.

BATEMAN
Two at nine? Perfect.

MAITRE D'
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is
also totally booked.

BATEMAN
See you then.

He hangs up the phone. He walks over to the coat rack. He
glances over at Jean, who is still standing in front of the
desk, confused.

BATEMAN
Yes? You're dressed...okay.

JEAN
You didn't give them a name.

BATEMAN
They know me.

Pause.

BATEMAN
Why don't you meet me at my house at seven o'clock
for drinks, okay?

She turns to leave.

BATEMAN
And Jean? You'll want to change before we go out.

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING

Jean stands by the floor-to-ceiling windows, looking out.

JEAN
Patrick, it's so...elegant. What a wonderful view.

Bateman opens up the freezer where Daisy's head is cleady
visible.

BATEMAN
Jean? Sorbet?

JEAN
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.

Bateman walks in with a bottle of wine and a corkscrew in
his hand and hands her the sorbet.

Jean is eating the sorbet.

JEAN
Want a bite?

BATEMAN
I'm on a diet. But thank you.

JEAN
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right?
You look great. Very fit.

BATEMAN
(Weighing the corkscrew examining the point for sharpness)
You can always he thinner. Look...better.

JEAN
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't
want to ruin your willpower.

BATEMAN
No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling
it anyway.

Silence, as Bateman walks around his apartment, opens up
his knife drawer, looking at the knives.

BATEMAN
So listen, what do you really want to do with your
life?

Pause.

BATEMAN
And don't tell me you enjoy working with children,
okay?

JEAN
Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school,
but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life
where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so...
I don't know...unsure.

Bateman is touching a knife in the drawer, feeling the edge
of the blade.

BATEMAN
Do you have a boyfriend?

JEAN
No, not really.

BATEMAN
Interesting.

JEAN
(Shyly)
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?

BATEMAN
Maybe. I don't know Not really.
Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very
Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly
ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape,
twine and a nail gun.

BATEMAN
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?

JEAN
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused
on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about
changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.

BATEMAN
Growing. I'm glad you said that.

Bateman picks up the duct tape.

BATEMAN
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie,
was named Lassie? Had you heard this?

JEAN
Who's Ted Bundy?

BATEMAN
Forget it.

JEAN
What's that?

BATEMAN
Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for...
taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the
nail gun.

JEAN
Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?

Jean puts her spoon down on the table.

BATEMAN
(Looking up from loading nails into the gun)
What...No! Put it in the carton.

JEAN
Sorry.
(She puts the spoon in the carton)

BATEMAN
Jean? What?

JEAN
Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?

From behind, we follow Bateman as he walks across the room and
stands behind the couch.

BATEMAN
I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just
want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.

JEAN
Hmmmm.

He points the nail gun at the back of Jean's head.
The phone RINGS. Startled, Bateman hides the nail gun
behind his back. The answering machine picks up. As Bateman
listens he discreetly places the nail gun behind the couch.
He sits down opposite Jean, enjoying her discomfort as she
listens to the message.

EVELYN
Patrick I know you're there. Pick up the phone, you bad boy.
What are you up to tonight? It's me. Don't try to hide. I hope
you're not out with some little number you picked up because
you're my Mr. Bateman. My boy next door. Anyway you never
called me and you said you would and I'll leave a message for
Jean about this too to remind you but we're having dinner with
Melania and Taylor-you know Melania, she went to Sweet Briar,
auld Taylor, he went to Cornell-and we're meeting at the Cornell
Club, so l'll call you tomorrow morning probably-bye, honey-oopps!
You hate that. Bye Mr. Big Time CEO Patrick. Bye. Bye.

Silence. Jean is obviously embarrassed and upset.

JEAN
Was that...Evelyn?

Silence.

JEAN
Are you still seeing her?

Silence.

JEAN
I'm sorry, I have no right to ask that.

Silence.

JEAN
Do you want me to go?

A long pause.

BATEMAN
Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.

JEAN
I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get
involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you
want me to go?

Another long pause.

BATEMAN
If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I
think I might hurt you.
(Almost hopefully)
You don't want to get hurt, do you?

JEAN
No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised.
You're right, I should go.

She gets up to leave.

JEAN
And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with
Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.

BATEMAN
Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.

He sinks back on the sofa and shuts his eyes.

INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Bateman enters P&P, walks up the corridor and pauses outside
the door to his office. He sees KIMBALL in conversation with
Jean, and Jean looking through her date book. He watches for
a moment, frozen with anxiety. He then bursts in, shutting
the door behind him.

BATEMAN
Kimball-I've been wanting to talk with you, Come
into my office. Jean, great jacket. Matsuda?

Jean looks flustered.

Kimball follows Bateman into his office.

KIMBALL
I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's
taken a leave of absence.

BATEMAN
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.
(Hopefully)
Is he a suspect?

KIMBALL
Not really.

A pause.

KIMBALL
Do you remember where you were on the night of
Paul's disappearance?
(He checks his notebook)
Which was on the twentieth of December?

BATEMAN
God...I guess...I was probably returning
videotapes.

He opens his desk drawer and pretends to search through his
diary.

BATEMAN
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.

KIMBALL
Wait. That's not what I've got.

BATEMAN
What?

KIMBALL
That's not the information I've received.

BATEMAN
Well...I...Wait...What information have
you received?

KIMBALL
Let's see...
(He flips through his notebook)
That you were with-

BATEMAN
Well, I could he wrong.

KIMBALL
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?

BATEMAN
(Clearly nervous and under pressure)
We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It
was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. I think we had dinner
at Orso's. No, Petaluma. No, Orso's. The...last time I
physically saw him was...at an automated teller. I can't
remember which...just one that was near, um, Nell's.

Kimball is clearly giving up on Bateman for now. He opens
his briefcase to put away his notebook.

KIMBALL
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.

BATEMAN
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long
day-a bit scattered.

KIMBALL
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch
in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?

BATEMAN
Great, yes, I'd like that.

KIMBALL
And if you could try and pin down where you were
the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a
lot easier.

BATEMAN
Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.

Kimball is rifling through his briefcase. He pulls out a
new shrink wrapped CD and holds it up.

KIMBALL
Huey Lewis and the News. Great stuff. Heard it? I
just bought it on my way here.

Bateman stares at the CD - stunned, terrified.

BATEMAN
Never. I mean...I don't really like...
singers.

KIMBALL
Not a big music fan, eh?

BATEMAN
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too...
black sounding. For me.

KIMBALL
Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll
call your secretary about reservations.

BATEMAN
I'll be there.

EXT. MEAT PACKING DISTRICT/INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

The same street corner where Bateman found Christie before.
The limo is kept idling as he talks to her through a
half-opened window.

CHRISTIE
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after
last time...

BATEMAN
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.

CHRISTIE
I don't think so.

He hands her a $500 bill.

BATEMAN
Just come in the limo and talk to me for a minute.

The driver's here, you'll be safe.

Christie gets in hesitantly.

BATEMAN
Nothing like last time, promise.

CHRISTIE
Alright.

He pours her a shot of vodka and makes her drink it.

BATEMAN
(Chatting as if they were at a cocktail party)
So, you're looking great, how have you been?

CHRISTIE
(A little confused)
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.

BATEMAN
(Mock shock)
Really?

CHRISTIE
My friend told me I should maybe even get a
lawyer.

BATEMAN
Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.

He writes her a check for $I ,000 to cash and hands it to
her. She snatches the check out of his hand and gets
quickly out of the limo, walking hurriedly down the street.

BATEMAN
Bitch.

He follows alongside her slowly in the limo, waving a huge
wad of cash at her. She hesitates; he uses the money to
lure her into the car. As she reluctantly gets into the
limo, she reaches for the money.

He snatches it away.

BATEMAN
Uh uh uh. Half now, half later.

She takes the money and puts it inside her shirt.

BATEMAN
Okay, your name is Christie. We're meeting a friend of mine,
Elizabeth. She'll be joining us in my new apartment shortly.
You'll like her. She's a very nice girl. Don't say anything
about yourself. Is that clear. Christie?

Christie nods.

INT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The living room: ELIZABETH has kicked off her shoes and flopped
down on the couch underneath the Baselitz. Elizabeth is an
attractive, dark-haired society girl who models occasionally.
Christie is sitting on the couch opposite her, pretending to
examine a CD.

ELIZABETH
You look really familiar. Did you you go to Dalton?

Christie shakes her head.

The kitchen: Bateman is grinding up tabs of Ecstasy and
putting them in a bottle of wine. In the living room, Elizabeth
is still staring at Christie as if she came from Mars.

ELIZABETH
I think I met you at Au Bar, didn't I ? With Spicey?

Christie looks blank.

ELIZABETH
Well, maybe not with Spicey but it was definitely at Au Bar.

Christie still blank.

ELIZABETH
You know, Au Bar?

Christie shakes her head.

ELIZABETH
Anyway, Au Bar sucks now, it's terrible. I went to a birth
day party there for Malcolm Forbes. Oh my God, please.

Bateman enters carrying the bottle of wine and two glasses.
Christie, who seems frightened, sips her wine and stares at
the floor. There is an awkward silence.

CHRISTIE
This is nicer than your other apartment.

BATEMAN
(Offended that she prefers Owen's apartment)
It's not that nice.

Silence.

CHRISTIE
Where did you two meet?

ELIZABETH
Oh God! I met him at, oh God, the Kentucky Derby in '86-no,
'87, and...
(Turning to Patrick)
You were hanging out with that bimbo Allison Poole.
(Sarcastically)
Hot number.

BATEMAN
What do you mean, she was a hot number.

ELIZABETH
If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.
(To Christie)
Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need
I say more?...What do you do?

A long silence. Christie reddens and stares at the floor.

BATEMAN
She's my...cousin.

ELIZABETH
(Skeptically)
Uh huh?

BATEMAN
She's from...France.

A pause. Elizabeth looks at Bateman dubiously.

ELIZABETH
Where's your phone? I've got to call Harley.

Bateman hands her a cordless phone. She dials, and stares
At Christie while she waits for someone to answer.

ELIZABETH
Where do you summer? Southampton?

Christie looks at Bateman and then back at Elizabeth.

CHRISTIE
No.

ELIZABETH
(Listening to the receiver)
Oh God, it's his machine.

BATEMAN
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.

ELIZABETH
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.

BATEMAN
Don't tell him you're here.

ELIZABETH
Why would I?

Bateman has poured her another glass of wine. She downs the
whole glass, making a face.

ELIZABETH
This tastes weird.
(She examines the label and shrugs)
Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway
you'd like. I'm at-

BATEMAN
(Whispering)
You're at Paul Owen s.

ELIZABETH
Who?

BATEMAN
(Whispering)
Paul Owen.

ELIZABETH
I want the number, idiot.
(She waves him away and continues into the reciever)
Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you later and if I
don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I'm going to sic my
hairdresser on you.

She hangs up.

ELIZABETH
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce
& Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?

BATEMAN
No.

ELIZABETH
Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon.

Bateman sits next to Elizabeth on the couch and pours her
another glass of the drugged wine.

BATEMAN
Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on.
What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.

ELIZABETH
(Laughing)
Patrick, you re a lunatic.

BATEMAN
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?

ELIZABETH
Let's not get lewd.
(Flirty)
I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.

BATEMAN
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.

ELIZABETH
(To Christie)
Does he do this all the time?

Christie shrugs.

BATEMAN
Christie, you're not drinking your wine.

Christie looks at her wine and gingerly takes a sip.

BATEMAN
(To Elizabeth)
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?

ELIZABETH
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?

BATEMAN
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.

ELIZABETH
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me
feel weird.

LATER:

Elizabeth is now writhing around on the couch and making
out with Christie. Bateman holds up a Whitney Houston CD,
showing them the picture of Whitney on the cover.

BATEMAN
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP
called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles
on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps
across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's
mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album
on a first listening.

ELIZABETH
You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You
actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?

She giggles, rolling off the sofa onto the floor.

BATEMAN
(Ignoring her)
It's hard to choose a favorite track
among so many great ones, but ""The Greatest Love of All""
is one of the best, most powerful songs ever written about
self-preservation and dignity. It's universal message
crosses all boundaries, and instills one with the hope
that it's not too late to better ourselves. to act kinder.
Since, Elizabeth, it's impossible in the world we live in
to empathize with others, we can always empathize with
ourselves.

As he speaks, he opens the case and carefully places the CD
in the player, admiring its pristine silver surface, and
watches it slide into the machine.

BATEMAN
It's an important message, crucial, really, and it's
beautifully stated on the album.

INT. BEDROOM - LATER

AN OUT-OF-FOCUS HOME VIDEO SHOT of Elizabeth, Christie and
Bateman in the throes of sex, in the master bedroom.

CUT BACK TO WIDE SHOT of the bedroom, partially blocked by
the video camera in the foreground. Their bodies are an
incoherent tangle of arms and legs. The only sounds are
moans, heavy breathing and the slapping of flesh against
flesh. CLOSE ON Christie's head and shoulders. Her eyes are
shut as she grimly concentrates on giving a good professional
performance, turning her head every so often to check the
progress of her partners.

OFFSCREEN WE HEAR Elizabeth panting in genuine pleasure,
moaning loudly. Her voice gets louder and louder and then
shifts to actual pain.

Bateman rises up off the bed, suddenly appearing behind
Christie. There is blood on his face.

Christie turns her head and sees him. She screams and leaps
off the bed, running out of the room. She slams the
mirrored door behind her, and as it swings shut for a split
second we see Elizabeth writhing in pain on the bed.

We follow Christie out of the room, panicking, screaming.

Christie runs down a darkened hallway, frantically opening
doors, looking for an escape.

She hears the SOUND OF A CHAINSAW coming from the bedroom.

She opens a closet. The closet lights up as she opens the
door and sees two dead, women hanging inside. She screams,
then claps a hand over her mouth. She stops and listens. THE
DISTANT SOUND OF THE CHAINSAW.

She backs away slowly, into another dark room, lit only by
the light from a television set. Through the darkness she
sees a head on the top of the TV and starts to whimper.

She runs toward the nearest door. Finding herself in the
main hallway, she begins to jog toward the front door, then
runs.

Bateman appears from nowhere, holding the chainsaw,
spattered with blood.

Christie screams and changes direction. Bateman leaps at
her, bellowing.

They run through the bedroom and into the bathroom.
Christie trips over Elizabeth's body, which is half in the
bathtub.

Both are slipping on the floor, which is slick with blood.

Christie falls, tries to get up. Bateman grabs her leg. He
tries to bite it.

She kicks him in the face and gets up, running toward the
front door.

He runs after her.

BATEMAN
Not the face, you bitch. Not the fucking face, you
piece of bitch trash!

Christie, screaming, makes it out the front door.

Bateman runs after her.

She runs down the hall screaming and banging on doors.

She moves to the elevator, pounding hysterically on the
buttons. She sees the stairwell and runs for it.

Bateman sees this and runs after her, revving the chainsaw.

She runs down the stairs, Bateman two flights behind her.
He stops, leans over the railing to look at her, then aims
the chainsaw at her and drops it.

Christie SCREAMS OFFSCREEN, then is suddenly silent.

FROM BATEMAN'S POV we see Christie's body sprawled facedown
at the bottom of the stairwell. The chainsaw sticks out of
her back like a sword.

INT. CRAYONS - EARLY EVENING

An insanely expensive restaurant with a childhood motif: paper
tablecloths and jars of crayons for drawing, lots of primary
colors, and a goldfish bowl on each table.

Bateman is at a table with Evelyn. They are both drawing on
the tablecloth. Bateman is drawing Christie with the
chainsaw in her back.

EVELYN
I want a firm commitment.

BATEMAN
I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.

Evelyn waves to a couple across the room.

EVELYN
(Distracted)
Why? What's wrong?

BATEMAN
(Speaking very carefully, measuring each word)
My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale
cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill
my needs.

The woman across the room holds up her hand, displaying a
new bracelet. Evelyn smiles and nods approvingly.

BATEMAN
We need to talk.

EVELYN
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk
about?

BATEMAN
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over

EVELYN
(Motioning to the waiter for water)
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just
avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?

BATEMAN
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This
is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.

EVELYN
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your
friends. I don't think it would work.
(Reaching over to dab his face with a napkin)
You have a little something on your upper lip.

BATEMAN
(Brushing her hand away)
I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about
that. You can have them.

Evelyn stares at him, suspicious and bewildered, a
realization dawning.

EVELYN
You're really serious, aren't you?

BATEMAN
Yes, I am.

EVELYN
But what about the past? Our past?

BATEMAN
We never really shared one.

EVELYN
You're inhuman.

BATEMAN
I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry.
(He pauses, as if searching for the right words)
You're just not terribly important to me.

Evelyn begins to cry.

EVELYN
No, no, no.

BATEMAN
I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.

She reaches desperately across the table and takes his
hand. Bateman pulls his hand away.

EVELYN
(Sobbing)
What do you want me to do, what is it you want?

The occupants of nearby tables begin to stare. Bateman is
becoming increasingly agitated and embarrassed.

BATEMAN
(Looking uncomfortably around the room)
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making
this scene right now.

EVELYN
Oh God, I can't believe this.

BATEMAN
I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going.

Evelyn makes an effort to compose herself. She blots the
tears so they will not affect her make-up.

EVELYN
(Surprisingly calm)
Where are you going?

BATEMAN
I'm just leaving.

EVELYN
But where?

BATEMAN
I have to return some videotapes.

He rushes out of the room.

EXT. TRIBECA STREET - EVENING

Bateman wanders into misty Tribeca streets, sees a stray cat.

BATEMAN
Here kitty, kitty.

The small mangy cat rubs against him. He picks it up and
walks toward an ATM, holding the cat. He puts his card in
the machine. The screen reads: FEED ME A STRAY CAT.
Bateman begins to attempt to shove the kitten into the
deposit slot with some difficulty. The kitten squeals. He
takes a gun from out of his pocket and points it at the
kitten. He doesn't notice the woman waiting behind him.

WOMAN
Oh my God! Stop that! What are you doing?

Bateman wheels around and shoots her. She falls screaming
to the floor.

Responding to the gunshot, A POLICE CAR SIREN WAILS in the
distance. Bateman breaks into a run. The police car
screeches after him.

COP CAR (O.S.)
HALT STOP. PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPON.

Bateman ducks down an alley.

EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

A COP rushes toward him, seemingly from
out of nowhere, and tackles him, trying to get the gun away
from him.

Bateman manages to shoot the cop in the face while both of
them have their hands on the gun, then shoots him again. He
reloads the gun. The sound of more COP CARS arriving.

He runs out of the alley.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

As he reaches the street, he finds A PHALANX OF POLICE CARS
approaching.

COP CAR
Halt. Put down your weapon.

The cops leap out and fire a warning shot in the air.
Bateman shoots at them. The police return fire.

Bateman ducks down behind a parked car and continues
shooting wildly. A bullet hits the gas tank of one of the
police cars. It catches fire and explodes. The flames light
up the scene, illuminating the bodies of policemen both living
and dead.

NEW ANGLE: Bateman flees from the scene. The camera follows
him as he runs along a row of Porsches, trying to open each
one, setting off a cacophony of CAR ALARMS.
THE SOUND OF POLICE SIRENS draws near.

NEW ANGLE: He runs, panting, until he ends up in front of a
tail, brilliantly lit office building. As he approaches,
the lights in the building are going off floor by floor.

INT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

He rushes into the lobby, running for the elevator.

NIGHT WATCHMAN
Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Smith? You
forgot to sign in.

Bateman wheels around and shoots him. He runs toward the
revolving doors. As he swings around in the doors, he
notices a JANITOR who has witnessed the shooting. He
revolves back into the lobby and shoots the janitor.

NEW ANGLE:

He runs out of the building and across the
street to an identical office building, the one that houses
Pierce & Pierce.

INT. PIERCE & PIERCE LOBBY - NIGHT

Bateman nods at the Pierce & Pierce NIGHT WATCHMAN and signs
in. He breathes a sigh of relief as the elevator doors close
behind him.

INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Bateman stands looking out
through the floor-length windows at a panoramic night view
of the city and the river.

Below him he sees a SWAT TEAM swarming over the roof of the
opposite building. There are ambulances standing by, flares
everywhere, distant sirens.

Suddenly, THE SOUND OF A HELICOPTER draws near. Frightened,
he drops to the floor behind his desk.

Helicopter searchlights scan the building, illuminating
Bateman's office for a few moments with a blaze of light.

He is crouched in one corner, half-sobbing, talking into
the phone, as the searchlight keeps circling.

BATEMAN
Harold, it's Bateman. Patrick Bateman. You're my
lawyer so I think you should know-I've killed a lot of
people. Some escort girls, in an apartment uptown, some
homeless people, maybe five or ten, an NYU girl I met in
Central Park. I left her in a parking lot, near Dunkin'
Donuts. I killed Bethany, my old girlfriend, with a nail
gun. and a man, some old faggot with a dog. Last week I
killed another girl with a chainsaw-I had to, she almost
got away There was someone else there, maybe a model, I
can't remember but she's dead too. And Paul Owen. I killed
Paul Owen with an ax, in the face. His body is dissolving
in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen. I don't want to leave anything
out here...I guess I've killed 20 people, maybe 40-I have tapes
of a lot of it. Some of the girls have seen the tapes, I even...
well, I ate some of their brains and I tried to cook a little.
Tonight I just, well, I had to kill a lot of people and I'm not
sure I 'm going to get away with it this time-I mean I guess
I'm a pretty sick guy. So-if you get hack tomorrow, I may show
up at Harry's Bar, so, you know, keep your eyes open.

Bateman hangs up the phone. The helicopter searchlight
circles back, briefly illuminating the room. The camera rises
up over Bateman huddled in the corner, staring blankly at the
sky.

INT. SMITH AND WOLLENSKY RESTAURANT - DAY

KIMBALL and Bateman are sitting at a corner table.

KIMBALL
(Very surprised)
No hash browns?

BATEMAN
Not in the mood, I guess.

KIMBALL
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I
mean- it's-have you been here before?

BATEMAN
(Deliberately nonchalant)
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not...
ordering them.

KIMBALL
(Looking at him like he's nuts)
Suit yourself, I guess.

Pause.

KIMBALL
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on
what you did?

BATEMAN
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some
sorbet?

KIMBALL
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.

BATEMAN
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?

KIMBALL
According to his date book, and this was verified by his
secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.

BATEMAN
And?

KIMBALL
I've questioned him.

BATEMAN
Marcus?

KIMBALL
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't
be sure.

BATEMAN
But Marcus denied it?

KIMBALL
Yes.

BATEMAN
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?

KIMBALL
Yes.

A pause.

BATEMAN
He does? You're sure?

KIMBALL
(smiling)
I checked it out. It's clean.

BATEMAN
Oh.
KIMBALL Now where were you?
(He laughs)

BATEMAN
(Laughing with him)
Where was Marcus?

KIMBALL
He wasn't with Paul
Owen.

BATEMAN
So who was he with?

KIMBALL
He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble,
Harry Newman, George Butner and –
(He pauses, Then looks up)
- you.

A moment of stunned silence.

BATEMAN
Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen
to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner
with Victoria...the following night.

KIMBALL
Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for
a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking.
Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or
later.
(A pause)
I mean, to think that one of his friends
killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too
ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?

McDermott stops by the table.

McDERMOTT
KIMBALL! How's the investigation?
Talking to Bateman? Don't believe a word he says.
(Laughs uproariously slapping him on the back)
Bateman, what's wrong with ,you?

Bateman looks at him in silence,
panicking.

McDERMOTT
You can't eat at Smith and Wollensky
without ordering the hash browns. Jesus, Bateman, you're a
raving maniac. Been at Pierce & Pierce too long.
(He wanders off muttering)
No fucking hash browns...

INT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Bateman walks into the lobby of Paul Owen's building. He
has a surgical mask in one hand.

DOORMAN
What can I do for you, sir?

BATEMAN
20B.

DOORMAN
Of course. Mrs. Wolfe is up there right now.

BATEMAN
Mrs. Wolfe?

DOORMAN
The real estate agent? You do have an appointment,
don't you?

Bateman steps out of the elevator and walks cautiously down
the hallway. Owen's door is open. The apartment is freshly
painted and has been immaculately redecorated in English
country-house style: overstuffed sofas, lots of chintz. There
are flowers everywhere, and a YOUNG YUPPIE COUPLE stands
admiring the place talkingto the realtor, MRS. WOLFE. Bateman
wanders down the hallway, looking for familiar signs. He stops
at the closet where we last saw two dead girls hanging. He
opens the door and the light switches on, but it is empty. Mrs.
Wolfe approaches, smiling.

MRS. WOLFE
Are you my two o'clock?

BATEMAN
No.

Mrs. Wolfe eyes him strangely, then looks down at the
surgical mash clutched in his hand. Her expression changes.

MRS. WOLFE
Can I help you?

BATEMAN
I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.

She stares at him impassively.

BATEMAN
Doesn't he live here?

MRS. WOLFE
No, he doesn't.

BATEMAN
Are you sure?

MRS. WOLFE
You saw the ad in the Times?

BATEMAN
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But...
doesn't Paul Owen still live here?

MRS. WOLFE
There was no ad in the Times.

Bateman is shaking as they continue to stare at each other.

MRS. WOLFE
I think you should go now.

BATEMAN
But I think...I want to know what happened
here.

MRS. WOLFE
Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.

Bateman backs away slowly.

MRS. WOLFE
Don't come back.

BATEMAN
I won't...don't worry.

Mrs. Wolfe glares at him as he walks down the hall,
rattled, and gets into the elevator.

EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

Bateman enters the revolving
door of an office building, panicking and breathing
heavily. He is sweating, his hair is wild, and he looks
deranged. He goes around the revolving door twice and comes
out onto the street again, where he bumps smack into a GUY
just like him.

GUY
Hey, Kinsley.

Bateman looks up at him wild-eyed.

GUY
See you at Fluties, okay?

The guy walks away, utterly unfazed. Bateman wanders down
the street, banging his briefcase against walls, garbage
cans, etc.

EXT. MIDTOWN PHONE BOOTH - DAY

Bateman searches his pockets
for pills. He finds three different pills and swallows
them. He's sweating, and takes his jacket off to wipe his
face, dialing a number.

JEAN (O.S.)
Patrick Bateman's office.

BATEMAN
Jean? Hello? Jean?

JEAN (O.S.)
Patrick? Is that you?

BATEMAN
Hello? Jean, I need help!

JEAN (O.S.)
Where are you?

BATEMAN
Jean-I'm not-

JEAN (O.S.)
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and
David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.

BATEMAN
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?

JEAN (O.S.)
Patrick? I can't hear you.

BATEMAN
What are I doing?

JEAN (O.S.)
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?

BATEMAN
I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.

Pause.

BATEMAN
...to the office this afternoon.

JEAN (O.S.)
Why?

BATEMAN
(Screaming)
Just...say...no!

JEAN (O.S.)
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?

BATEMAN
Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!

He hangs up. He throws the Walkman which is around his neck
into a nearby trash can, and wipes his face with his
jacket.

INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE- SAME DAY

Jean sits at Bateman's desk. She looks around, and then opens
his desk drawer and tentatively begins to search through it.

INT. HARRY'S BAR - EVENING

Bateman comes into the bar, a little cleaned up from the
previous scene (he's smoothed his hair), but still panicking
and disheveled. He spots his friends in a corner, sits down,
still breathing heavily.

Price is on his cell-phone, trying to get reservations.

McDERMOTT
Bateman, you're looking a little wild-eyed rough
day at the office?

They all laugh.

McDERMOTT
Hey, look-Price is back. And he's drinking
Perrier. He s a changed man. Except...he still can't
get a reservation to save his life.

Bateman sits down silently.

McDERMOTT
Why don't you try I 50 Wooster? Just fucking call them.

BATEMAN
(On automatic)
I'm not going anywhere unless we
have a reservation.

VAN PATTEN Le Cirque, Flamingo East, Oyster Bar, come on,
faggots-just get a res.

PRICE
Keep your shirt on. Maybe lose the suspenders.

Bateman spots HAROLD CARNES at the bar, tenses.

BATEMAN
(He downs his drink)
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back.
He approaches Carnes cautiously.

CARNES
Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the
end of the '90s.

Bateman approaches, trying to act casual.

BATEMAN
Shut up, Carnes, they will not.

Carnes is surprised, turns around, looks vaguely confused.

BATEMAN
So, Harold, did you get my message?

Carnes lights a cigarette, stalling. Then laughs.

CARNES
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you,
wasn't it?

BATEMAN
(Waving smoke out of his face)
Yes, naturally.

CARNES
Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s
fabulous. That's rich...

Pause

CARNES
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?

BATEMAN
What exactly do you mean?

CARNES
The message you left.

Carnes is distracted, waving at people.

CARNES
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still
seeing her, right?

BATEMAN
But wait, Harold, what do you mean?

Carnes isn't really listening.

CARNES
Excuse me. Nothing. Good to see you. Is that Edward Towers?

He turns to go.

BATEMAN
Carnes? Wait.

CARNES
(Sighing)
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing.
But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork,
such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully
appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said
Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's
have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.

BATEMAN
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?

CARNES
Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let
alone...what was it you said he did to her?

Carnes looks around the club, raises his glass to a passing
couple. He laughs politely.

CARNES
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...

BATEMAN
(Desperate, shouting)
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really
comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes.
I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off.
I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your
machine was true.

CARNES
Excuse me. I really must he going.

BATEMAN
No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm
Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time!
Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.

Carnes stares at him in confusion and annoyance.

BATEMAN
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed
Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer

CARNES
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find
this funny anymore.

BATEMAN
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?

CARNES
(Eyeing Bateman worriedly)
It's just not.

BATEMAN
Why not, you stupid bastard?

Carnes stares at him.

CARNES
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in
London...just ten days ago.

BATEMAN
No, you...didn't?

CARNES
Now, if you'll excuse me.

Bateman returns back to his friends' table, in a daze.
They are all looking at the television, where Ronald
Reagan is giving a speech about Iran Contra. They are
halfheartedly arguing about whether or not he's
lying.

PRICE
How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?

VAN PATTEN
What shit? Now where do we have reservations at?
I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have
reservations somewhere.

PRICE
(To Bateman)
I don't believe it. He looks so...normal. He seems so...
out of it. So...undangerous.

McDERMOTT
He is totally harmless you geek. Was totally harmless.
Just like you are totally harmless. But he did do all that
shit and you have failed lo get us into I 50, so, you know,
what can I say?

PRICE
I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that
way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so
fucking, I don't know, cool about it?

VAN PATTEN
Some guys are just born cool, I guess.

Bateman laughs at this. Price shoots him a look.

PRICE
And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?

BATEMAN
I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'.
VAN PATTEN
(To Price) Rehab's done wonders for you, pal.
Working for UNICEF now?

McDERMOTT
Do you want another Perrier Timothy? Some seltzer water?

PRICE
Oh brother look-he presents himself as a harmless
Old codger. But inside...

Pause.

PRICE
But inside...

The SOUNDS OF THE BAR FADE AWAY and we hear Bateman's thoughts:

BATEMAN (V.O.)
But inside doesn't matter...

THE SOUNDS OF THE BAR RETURN.

McDERMOTT
(Bored)
Inside? Yes, inside? Believe it or not, Price we're actually
listening to you.

PRICE
Bateman? Come on, what do you think?

Bateman looks up and smiles at Price. Then shrugs.

BATEMAN
Whatever.

The conversation breaks up as Van Patten takes out his phone.

VAN PATTEN
Whose moronic idea was it to drink dry beers? I need a Scotch.

The sounds of the bar fade down. The following voiceover runs
over images of Bateman and his friends ordering drinks, talking
on portable phones, talking, laughing - combined with images of
other very similar young men at other tables drinking, talking
on portable phones, talking, laughing,

BATEMAN (V.O.)
There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with
the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil,
all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward
it, I have now surpassed...

INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Jean is alone in Bateman's office, looking through his diary.
We see the pages that she is looking at. They are filled with
doodles of mutilated women and their names...Jean looks lost
and frightened, and begins to cry.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better
world for anyone. I fact I want my pain to be inflicted on
others. I want no escape.

INT. HARRY'S BAR - EARLY EVENING
As the film ends the camera moves CLOSE on Bateman. He is
leaning back in his leather armchair, drinking a double Scotch,
his eyes blank.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
But even after admitting this, there is no catharsis. I gain no
deeper knowledge about myself, no new knowledge can be extracted
from my telling. There has been no reason for me to tell you any
of this. This confession has meant nothing...

The camera moves up to a sign on the wall behind him:
""THIS IS NOT AN EXIT.""

[Verse 1]
Yea all this stress on my brain right
Poker face, I’m in the game right
Need a week to think, maybe 8 nights
Some promethazine and a straight flight
Let me cut off my phone, let me get in my zone
Let me center myself, just leave a nigga alone
I be back in a few, got some rappin' to do
Got some stacking still runnin', got some lapping to do
All, Jokes to the side, nigga know that they ain’t fucking with the flow I provide
Y'all, notice how I started and now a flow has evolved
And me and Ralo Styles like Wade and Lebron
And it’s all money in and your bros is in charge
Hoes in ménage for those rose carte blanche
In them out of town suites ‘cus they know we the ones
Equity nigga, what ive chosen, of course
No 360’s, clothing and tour
When I do drop I’mma blow past niggas
And I toe tag niggas like I told 'em before
Got flow, got whores
Got dough, get more
Fuck mine, get yours
And the show just started, nigga hold your applause
Tryna get to my spot
Look, you gotta go up floors
I put the 6 on stock, I was runnin' through tires like chicks on tour
And if im at the game, you can bet your bottom dollar that I sit on floor
And if im at the fight, you can bet your bottom dollar sweat hit my whore
[Hook]
Won’t take no loss, won’t take days off
We go so hard, until we fall
Won’t take no loss, won’t take days off
We go so hard, until we fall
A nigga used to dream, my reality’s a dream now
Nigga used to dream, my reality’s a dream now
I’m livin' out my dreams now
Livin' out my dreams now now now

[Verse 2]
Sittin' in the trap like damn tryin' to turn
Couple grams to a couple hundred grand
I grew up in a town they don’t make it out of
If you black you don’t live to see a man
You see 21, you done won the lottery
Talkin' friends, when the streets there
Took a lot from me, I washed up from a robbery
Now your name 4657239B state property
Yea, you had a dream, now you livin' out a nightmare
You almost made it little nigga you was right there
Now your release date is in another light year
Yea, and it’s quite clear
All you needed was a little bit of guidance
And your household it was just silence
You was your own mother and your father
How the hell you supposed to know what to do when nobody showed you the ropes
All they showed you was pistols and dope
Gang flags in the land with no hope
Where every fitted hat mean a different hood
Make it out & they still want you in the hood
Your own homies don't want you livin good
Niggas for they self, get it understood
Its just a playground full of mood swings
Die for the color of your shoe strings
Wish I had a different way to view things
You either had a rap hook or a hoop dream
From El Segundo to Slauson
Me and Nipsey, we young bosses
Never takin' no losses
Check the garments nigga, life's marvelous
[Hook]
Won’t take no loss, won’t take days off
We go so hard, until we fall
Won’t take no loss, won’t take days off
We go so hard, until we fall

Nigga used to dream, my reality’s a dream now

Put on your yarmulke
It's time for Chanukah
Once again it's on-aka
The miracle of Chanukah

Give it up for the Drei-Dels everybody!

[Pre-Verse]
Chanukah is the Festival of Lights
One day of presents? Hell, no, we get Eight Crazy Nights
But if you still feel like the only kid in town without a Christmas tree
I guess my first two songs didn't do it for you, so here comes number three

[Verse 1: Adam Sandler & Rob Schneider]
Ross and Pheobe from Friends say the Chanukah blessing
So does Lenny's pal Squiggy and Will and Grace's Debra Messing
Melissa Gilbert and Michael London never mix meat with dairy
Maybe they shoulda called that show Little Kosher House on the Prairie
We've got Jerry Lewis, Ben Stiller, and Jack Black
Tom Arnold converted to Judaism but you guys can have him back
(Just kidding Tommy!)

We may not get to kiss underneath the mistletoe
But we can do it all night long with Deuce Bigelow
I'm Jewish
Oh my gosh, we got Schneider in here!
[Chorus: The Drei-Dels]
Put on your yarmulke, here comes Chanukah

The guy in Willie Nelson's band who plays harmonica
Celebrates Chanukah
Oh, good job Schneider! Alright now

[Verse 2: Adam Sandler & Rob Schneider]
Osama Bin Laden, not a big fan of the Jews
Well maybe that 's because he lost a figure-skating match
To gold medalist Sarah Hughes—her mama's Jewish
Houdini and David Blaine escape straitjackets with such precision
But the one thing they could not get out of— their painful circumcision
As for great actors, Sean Penn is quite the great one
And Marlon Brando, not a Jew at all! But looks to me like he ate one. Yeah!

There's Lou Reed, Perry Farrell, Beck and Paula Abdul
Joey Ramone invented punk rock music but first came Hebrew school

[Chorus: Adam Sandler]
Hey, Natalie Portman-ukah
It's time to celebrate Chanukah
I hope I get an abtronika
On this joyful, toyful Chanukah
So get a high colonika
And soil your long John-ukahs
If you really, really wanna-ka
Have a happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy...
Happy Chanukah!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

[Intro: Just Blaze]
Hey!
It's coming
Ladies and gentlemen; this time around
The revolution will not be televised
Woo! As we proceed!
To give you what you need!
'09, mother—!
Get live, mother—!
Ladies and gentlemen of the court
In the hearing against The State of Hip-Hop vs. Jay Electronica
I present: Exhibit C

[Verse 1: Jay Electronica & Just Blaze]
When I was sleepin' on the train
Sleepin' on Meserole Ave out in the rain
Without even a single slice of pizza to my name
Too proud to beg for change, mastering the pain
When New York niggas was calling southern rappers lame
But then jacking our slang (Oh!)
I used to get dizzy spells, hear a little ring
The voice of an angel telling me my name
Telling me that one day I'ma be a great mane
Transforming with the Megatron Don, spittin' out flames (Oh!)
Eating wack rappers alive, shittin' out chains (Woo!)
I ain't believe it then; nigga, I was homeless (Uh huh)
Fightin', shootin' dice, smokin' weed on the corners
Trying to find the meaning of life in a Corona
'Til the Five Percenters rolled up on a nigga and informed him:
""You either build or destroy, where you come from?""
""The Magnolia projects in the 3rd Ward slum""
""Hmm, it's quite amazing that you rhyme how you do
And that you shine like you grew up in a shrine in Peru"" (Ooh!)
Question Fourteen, Muslim Lesson Two:
Dip-dive-uh, civilize a eighty-five-uh
I make the devil hit his knees and say the ""Our Father""
Abracadabra, you rocking with the true and living
Shout out to Lights Out, Joseph I, Chewy Bivens
Shout out to Baltimore, Baton Rouge, my crew in Richmond
While y'all debated who the truth was like Jews and Christians
I was on Cecil B., Broad Street, Master
North Philly, South Philly, 23rd, Tasker
Six Mile, Seven Mile, Hartwell, Gratiot (Oh!)
Where niggas really would pack a U-Haul truck up
Put the high beams on, drive up on the curb
At a barbecue and hop up out the back like, ""What's up?"" (Buh!)
Kill a nigga, rob a nigga, take a nigga, bust up
That's why when you talk the tough talk, I never feel you
You sound real good and you play the part well
But the energy you givin' off is so unfamiliar
I don't feel ya (We need somethin' realer! Ooh!)
[Verse 2: Jay Electronica & Just Blaze]
Nas hit me up on the phone, said ""What you waitin' on?""
Tip hit me up with a tweet, said, ""What you waitin' on?""
Diddy send a text every hour on the dot saying
""When you gon' drop that verse? Nigga, you taking long""
So now I'm back spittin' that heat, could pass a polygraph
That Reverend Run rockin' Adidas out on Hollis Ave
That FOI, Marcus Garvey, Nikky Tesla
I shock you like an eel, electric feel, Jay Electra
Oh my God! Keep going!
[Verse 3: Jay Electronica & Just Blaze]
They call me Jay Electronica—fuck that
Call me Jay Elec-Hanukkah, Jay Elec-Yarmulke
Jay Elect-Ramadan, Muhammad as-salaam-alaikum
RasoulAllah Subhanahu wa ta'ala through your monitor (Ooh!)
My Uzi still weigh a ton; check the barometer
I'm hotter than the motherfucking sun; check the thermometer
I'm bringing ancient mathematics back to modern man
My mama told me, ""Never throw a stone and hide your hand""
I got a lot of family, you got a lot of fans
That's why the people got my back like the Verizon man
I play the back and fade to black, and then devise a plan
Out in London, smoking, vibing while I ride the tram
Giving out that raw food to lions disguised as lambs
And—by the time they get they seats hot
And deploy all they henchmen to come at me from the treetops
I'm chillin' out at Tweetstock, building by the millions
My light is brilliant
[Outro: Just Blaze]
Woooo!
I rest my case
'09, Act 3
First chapter of the end
The last chapter of a new beginning
If it's so
The things we do without even trying...
Be better than a lot of y'all records, don't get mad
Morning after, world premiere
Me!
For real, though?
I ain't even gon' say nothing
Matter of fact; I ain’t saying—
I don't even know why I'm sayin’ this
